## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Grammar
- ❌ Present perfect confusion with simple past — ensure distinction is clear
- ❌ Superlative without "the" — "the most exciting" not "most exciting"
- ❌ Conditional Type 2 ("If I were...") — not yet, stick to Type 1
- ❌ Third conditional ("If I had known...") — not yet
- ❌ Complex noun clauses — not yet
- ❌ Inversion structures — too advanced

### Vocabulary
- ❌ Low-frequency words — stick to core 1,500-2,500
- ❌ Overly specialized academic vocabulary — not needed
- ❌ Complex abstract concepts — keep it accessible

### Content
- ❌ Topics too childish — respect junior high graduate intelligence
- ❌ Too formal — maintain natural tone
- ❌ Boring narrative — add engaging plotlines and personal connections
