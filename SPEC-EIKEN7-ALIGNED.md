# Eiken Grade 7 Level Specification (PROVISIONAL)
## Aligned to Official Eiken Announcement — NOT Exam Data

**Created:** 24 February 2026  
**Based on:** Official Eiken announcement (January 30, 2026 PDF)  
**URL:** https://www.eiken.or.jp/eiken/info/2026/pdf/20260130_info_2026newgrade.pdf  
**Status:** ⚠️ **PROVISIONAL — Requires revision when official Grade 7 exams become available**  
**Target:** 48 stories over 12-month curriculum (4 stories/month × 12 months)

---

## ⚠️ PROVISIONAL DISCLAIMER — CRITICAL

**This blueprint is EDUCATED GUESSWORK based on official Eiken announcement PDF, NOT actual exam data.**

**Key Limitations:**
- No actual Grade 7 past exams exist yet (not administered as of 2026-02-24)
- This specification extrapolates from official announcement details only
- Grammar priorities, vocabulary distribution, and question patterns are PROVISIONAL estimates
- **This blueprint must be revised when actual Grade 7 exam data becomes available**

**Reliance:** This specification uses findings from `research-eiken67-levels.md` which analysed the official Eiken announcement PDF. It does NOT reflect test reality from actual exams because none exist yet.

**Required Action:** When official Grade 7 first administration occurs (late 2026 or 2027), analyse the actual exam PDFs and revise this blueprint accordingly.

## 1. Level Overview — Grade 7 Summary

### Profile
- **Official Description:** Very young beginners, early elementary students, "Discovery Level" — introduction to English assessment
- **CEFR Equivalent:** Below A1 (pre-A1)
- **Test Reality (Official Announcement):** Vocabulary acquisition, NOT grammar; ultra-simple sentence structures
- **Vocabulary Scope:** 50-200 words (target ~150 average) — LOWEST Eiken level
- **Sentence Length:** 5-8 words average (ultra-short, TV-readable)
- **Proficiency Level:** Pre-beginner — absolute first exposure to formal English assessment
- **Critical Constraint:** Sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously

### Grade 7 in the Eiken Hierarchy

**Level Order (LOWEST TO HIGHEST):**
- **Grade 7** (NEW, lowest) ← THIS LEVEL ← 50-200 words, Be-verb + Present Simple ONLY
- **Grade 6** (NEW, introductory) — 300-500 words, Present Simple + limited Present Continuous
- **Grade 5** (existing) — 558 words, Present Continuous dominant
- **Grade 4** (existing)
- **Grade 3** (existing)
- **準2級** (existing)
- **準2級プラス** (existing)
- **2級** (existing)
- **準1級** (existing)
- **1級** (existing)

### Critical Transition: Grade 7 → Grade 6

| Metric | Grade 7 | Grade 6 | Change | Significance |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|--------------|
| Vocabulary | 50-200 words | 300-500 words | +250% | Massive vocabulary expansion |
| Sentence length | 5-8 words | 8-12 words | +50-60% | Shift to basic sentence structures |
| Grammar | Be-verb + Present Simple ONLY | Present Simple + limited Present Continuous | New: Present Continuous | First exposure to continuous tenses |
| Reading passages | 20-30 words | 50-80 words | +150-200% | Passage length increases significantly |
| Writing section | None | 5-10 words | NEW | Writing introduced at Grade 6 |

**Note on Sentence Length:** Grade 7 sentences are intentionally short (5-8 words) to accommodate the youngest learners and TV readability. Grammar is deliberately minimal (Be-verb + Present Simple) because the focus is vocabulary acquisition, NOT grammar complexity.

### What Makes Grade 7 Different

**Like no other Eiken level:**
1. **NO grammar progression** — All 48 stories at identical difficulty
2. **Vocabulary focus ONLY** — Word recognition, not grammar rules
3. **NO writing section** — Official format excludes writing entirely
4. **Picture-heavy format** — Visual support is likely based on announcement
5. **Ultra-short passages** — 20-30 words (3-4 sentences) vs. Grade 5's 150-200 words
6. **Yes/No or 1-word answers** — Questions require minimal output

**Philosophy:** Grade 7 exists to build confidence and introduce students to formal English assessment through vocabulary recognition, not through grammatical complexity. This is a "discovery level" where students encounter English words in simple, predictable contexts.

## 2. Test Reality Summary — What Official Announcement Shows

### The Official Announcement Data

**Source:** Eiken announcement PDF dated January 30, 2026
**Key Specifications:**

| Component | Official Specification | Impact on Teaching |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Vocabulary** | 50-200 words | Focus on word recognition, NOT grammar |
| **Grammar** | Present Simple + Be-verb ONLY | NO continuous tenses, NO modals, NO complex questions |
| **Sentence length** | 5-8 words average | Ultra-short, simple structures |
| **Reading passages** | 20-30 words (3-4 sentences) | Extremely short vs. other levels |
| **Writing section** | None (official format) | Students do NOT write paragraphs |
| **Speaking (optional)** | 1-2 sentence responses | Very basic output |

### Four Pillars of Grade 7 Success

#### 1. Vocabulary Acquisition (PRIMARY SKILL)

**What the announcement shows:**
- 50-200 target words (much lower than Grade 5's 558)
- Categories: family, animals, colours, numbers, food, toys
- Focus on recognition, NOT production
- Simple, concrete words only (no abstract concepts)

**Teaching implications:**
- Introduce 3-5 new words per story
- Recognise words in context
- Match words to pictures or simple definitions
- NO emphasis on grammatical accuracy

#### 2. Be-Verb Mastery (is/are/am)

**Core forms:**
- "I am..." (first person singular)
- "You are..." (second person)
- "He/She/It is..." (third person singular)
- "We/They are..." (plural)

**Uses:**
- Simple identification: "This is a cat."
- Basic descriptions: "The sky is blue."
- Locations: "My school is here."

**EXCLUDED (based on official announcement):**
- NO Present Continuous ("is jumping", "are playing")
- NO Past Be-verb ("was/were")
- NO questions beyond "Is it...?" or "Are they...?"

#### 3. Present Simple Statements

**Core pattern:** Subject + Verb (s form for third person singular)

**Examples:**
- "I like dogs."
- "She plays games."
- "They walk to school."

**EXCLUDED (based on official announcement):**
- NO Present Continuous ("I am playing")
- NO Modals ("can", "should", "must")
- NO Complex Wh-questions ("Why", "When", "How")
- ONLY basic Yes/No questions: "Is it a dog?", "Do you like cats?"

#### 4. Simple Yes/No Questions

**Question types:**
- Be-verb questions: "Is it red?", "Are they happy?"
- Present Simple DO questions: "Do you like apples?", "Does he play?"

**Question characteristics:**
- One-syllable answers preferred ("Yes", "No", "Cat", "Red")
- NO multi-word sentence answers
- NO inference or complex thinking

### The "Vocabulary NOT Grammar" Principle

**Critical insight from announcement:**

Grade 7's purpose is **vocabulary acquisition**, NOT grammar teaching. The official description explicitly states:

> "Focus: Vocabulary acquisition, NOT grammar"

**Teaching implications:**
- Don't teach grammar rules explicitly
- Students should recognise patterns THROUGH exposure
- Mistakes in grammar are EXPECTED and acceptable
- Prioritise learning new words over grammatical accuracy

**Example story focus:**
- ✅ GOOD: Learn 5 new animal words in a story ("cat", "dog", "bird", "fish", "rabbit")
- ❌ WRONG: Teach Present Simple rule of adding "-s" for third person singular

**Assessment expectation:** Students should recognise and understand words in context. Grammatical accuracy is NOT the primary assessment criterion.

---

## 3. Grammar Priorities — PROVISIONAL Allocation

### ⚠️ PROVISIONAL NOTE — No Grammar Priorities Table

**Unlike other Eiken levels (Grade 1-5), Grade 7 does NOT have grammar priorities because:**

1. **Grammar is too simple** — Only Be-verb + Present Simple vs. 8-10 grammar categories at higher levels
2. **NO progression** — All 48 stories use identical grammar (no tiered allocation)
3. **Vocabulary focus** — The official announcement emphasises vocabulary, NOT grammar

**Therefore, there is NO "Grammar Priorities by Tier" table for Grade 7.**

---

### Grade 7 Grammar Inventory (PROVISIONAL)

**Based on official announcement, Grade 7 grammar includes ONLY:**

| Grammar Feature | Forms Include | Stories Using This | Notes |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Be-verb (Present)** | is, are, am | ALL 48 stories | Core structure |
| **Present Simple** | I like, She plays, They walk | ALL 48 stories | Core structure |
| **Basic Yes/No Questions** | Is it...? Do you...? | ALL 48 stories (questions only) | Simple questions only |

**EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED (based on announcement):**

| Grammar Feature | Reason for Exclusion |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Present Continuous | NOT mentioned in announcement |
| Past Simple | NOT mentioned in announcement |
| Past Be-verb (was/were) | NOT mentioned in announcement |
| Modals (can, could, should, must) | NOT mentioned in announcement |
| Complex Wh-questions | Announcement specifies VERY short exchanges only |
| Possessives (my, your, his, etc.) | Too complex for 50-200 word level |
| Prepositions (in, on, at) | Too complex for ultra-simple stories |

### PROVISIONAL Grammar Distribution

**Pattern:** MIXED ONLY — ALL 48 stories at same difficulty

| Grammar Feature | Frequency per Story | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Be-verb sentences | 3-5 instances | "This is a cat." |
| Present Simple sentences | 5-7 instances | "I like dogs." |
| Yes/No questions | 10 total (story end) | "Is it red?", "Do you like...?" |

**Total sentences per story:** 10 (all Be-verb or Present Simple)

**NO progression across 48 weeks** — grammatical complexity does NOT increase.

---

## 4. Story Distribution Table — 48 Stories by Theme

### ⚠️ PROVISIONAL NOTE — No Grammar Categories Table

**Unlike higher levels, Grade 7 does NOT distribute stories by "Grammar Category" because:**

1. **Grammar is identical** across all 48 stories (no variation)
2. **Vocabulary varies by month** (the only distinguishing feature)
3. **MIXED pattern only** — No "focus weeks" or "category rotation"

**Therefore, this section shows MONTHLY themes instead of grammar-based distribution.**

**Seasonal content for Grade 7 is SIMPLE and OPTIONAL:**

- Primary focus: Very young learners (early elementary)
- Content must be RELATABLE to children (ages 5-8 estimated)
- Complex seasonal events (Christmas traditions, cultural ceremonies) are TOO ADVANCED
- Keep cultural references basic and concrete

---

### Grade 7 Seasonal Alignment (SIMPLIFIED)

## 7. Writing Guidelines — Sentence Length, Vocabulary, Complexity

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Sentence Length Requirements (5-8 Words Average)

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Average sentence length** | 5-8 words per sentence | **TV-readable with translations** |
| **Minimum sentence length** | 3 words | Avoid fragments |
| **Maximum sentence length** | 10 words | **STRICT limit** — No long sentences |
| **Sentence length variety** | 3-8 word range | Keep very simple and consistent |
| **Percentage of sentences** (7-8 words) | 20-30% | Occasional slightly longer sentences |

**Critical Constraint:** All sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously. This constraint applies to **Grade 7** specifically because young learners cannot process long sentences alongside translations.

### Sentence Length Examples for Grade 7

**Correct Examples (5-8 words):**
- "This is a cat." (5 words)
- "I like to play." (5 words)
- "My dog is big." (5 words)
- "The sky is blue today." (6 words)
- "She plays with her friends." (6 words)
- "We go to school." (5 words)
- "I eat an apple every day." (7 words)
- "They run in the park." (6 words)

**INCORRECT Examples (too long):**
- ❌ "This is a very big cat that has a long tail." (11 words) → Too long
- ❌ "I like to play with my friends at the park." (9 words) → Too long
- ❌ "She goes to school every morning with her friends." (9 words) → Too long

### Vocabulary Level Requirements

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Total vocabulary scope** | 150 words (average) | From 50-200 word official range |
| **Average per story** | 3-5 new words | Introduce gradually |
| **Word type** | Concrete, simple concepts ONLY | NO abstract words |
| **Word complexity** | 1-2 syllables preferred | Keep words short and simple |
| **Word categories** | Family, animals, colours, numbers, food, toys | Specified themes |

### Vocabulary Categories by Theme

| Month | Theme | Word Examples (3-5 words/story) |
|-------|-------|-------------------------------|
| **January** | My Family | mother, father, family, home, house |
| **February** | Animals | cat, dog, bird, rabbit, animal |
| **March** | Colours | red, blue, green, yellow, colour |
| **April** | Numbers | one, two, three, number, count |
| **May** | Food | apple, banana, fruit, food, eat |
| **June** | Toys | doll, ball, toy, game, play |
| **July** | School | book, pen, school, student, learn |
| **August** | Games | run, jump, fun, win, swim |
| **September** | Friends | friend, boy, girl, love, kind |
| **October** | Seasons | warm, hot, cool, cold, weather |
| **November** | Routines | morning, day, night, sleep, wake |
| **December** | Celebrations | happy, birthday, cake, gift, love |

### Complexity Requirements (VERY Simple for Grade 7)

#### Clause Structure

| Requirement | Target | Example for Grade 7 |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Complex sentences** | 0% | NO complex sentences |
| **Compound sentences** | 0% | NO compound sentences (with "and", "but") |
| **Simple sentences** | 100% | ONLY simple sentences (subject + verb) |
| **Subordinate clauses** | 0% | NO subordinate clauses ("because", "when") |
| **Embedding depth** | 0 | NO embedding |

**Grammar Constraints:**
- NO conjunctions ("and", "but", "or") in story sentences (keeps sentences short)
- NO complex explanations
- NO dependent clauses
- ONLY independent, simple sentences

**Example Transformation:**
- *Example for higher levels:* "The cat is black and it likes to play with the dog." (13 words, compound)
- *Grade 7 version:* "The cat is black. It plays with the dog." (7 words + 6 words, two simple sentences)

---

### Cohesion and Coherence

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| **Paragraph transitions** | None required (each story is 10 simple sentences in a row) |
| **Thematic consistency** | One simple theme per story (e.g., "family members", "pets") |
| **Logical flow** | Linear, chronological (e.g., "This is X. I like X.") |
| **Referential clarity** | Use names or nouns (not pronouns) to avoid confusion |

**Cohesion Strategy for Grade 7:**
- Use specific nouns repeatedly (e.g., "The cat", "The dog")
- Avoid pronouns ("it", "he", "she") when unclear
- Keep topics focused (one theme per story)

**Example Cohesive Story:**
```
Line 1: This is a cat. (6 words)
Line 2: The cat is black. (5 words)
Line 3: It likes to play. (5 words)
Line 4: The cat jumps up. (5 words)
Line 5: It runs very fast. (5 words)
Line 6: I love my cat. (5 words)
Line 7: We play together. (4 words)
Line 8: The cat is happy. (5 words)

```

## 9. Story Structure — Format Requirements

### ⚠️ PROVISIONAL NOTE: Grade 7 Format is SIMPLIFIED

**Grade 7 stories follow a simplified structure compared to higher levels:**

- NO complex academic content
- NO hedging markers
- NO discourse markers
- NO academic passive
- NO modals

**Grade 7 stories use ONLY:**
- Be-verb sentences: "This is a cat.", "My dog is big."
- Present Simple sentences: "I like dogs.", "She plays games."

---

### Content Format Requirements

Each story contains 20 lines total:
- **Lines 1-10:** 10 STORY sentences with emoji + English + Japanese
- **Lines 11-20:** 10 DISCUSSION questions with emoji + English + Japanese

**⚠️ CRITICAL JAPANESE TRANSLATION RULE:**

**ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS**

Lines 1-10 (Story sentences): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)
Lines 11-20 (Questions): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)

**EVERY LINE format:**
```
[Emoji] [English: 3-8 words]
[Japanese translation]
```

❓ Do you like dogs?
```

**✅ CORRECT (Japanese on ALL lines):**
```
🐱 Is it your cat?
それはあなたの猫ですか？

🐶 Do you like dogs?
あなたは犬が好きですか？
```

---

### Grade 7 Story vs. Question Pattern

**Story Sentences (Lines 1-10):**
- Simple statements about a theme (e.g., "family members", "pets", "colours")
- Each sentence is 3-8 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Sentences form a simple narrative about everyday topics
- Grammar: Be-verb OR Present Simple (NO advanced grammar)

**Discussion Questions (Lines 11-20):**
- **STAND-ALONE simple questions** anyone can answer
- Each question is 3-8 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Questions use **similar grammar** to the story but are about the **THEME**
- Questions do NOT require reading the story
- Questions are Yes/No or 1-word answers only

**Example from Grade 7 (Pets theme):**

**Story Sentences (about pets):**
```
🐱 This is a cat.
これは猫です。

🐶 The dog is big.
犬は大きいです。

🐰 I like the rabbit.
私はウサギが好きです。

[... 7 more story sentences ...]
```

**Discussion Questions (about the theme - pets):**
```
🐱 Is it your cat?
それはあなたの猫ですか？

🐶 Do you like dogs?
あなたは犬が好きですか？

❤️ Do you love animals?
あなたは動物を愛していますか？

[... 7 more questions about pets ...]
```

**Pattern:** Same format for ALL 20 lines:
```
😊 English sentence OR question (3-8 words).
日本語の翻訳です。
```

---

### JSON Code Example

```javascript
{
    title: "1. My Family (Family Members)",
    content: `👨 This is my father.
これは父です。

👩 This is my mother.
これは母です。

👶 We are a happy family.
私たちは幸せな家族です。

👨 Is it your father?
それはあなたの父ですか？

👩 Is she your mother?
彼女はあなたの母ですか？

❤️ Do you love your family?

- **Expected source file:** `textbook/eiken7.js` (to be created)
- **Note:** This format follows the same structure as Grade 1, but with simpler vocabulary and grammar

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Format Violations That Will Result in Rejection

**WRONG FORMAT (do NOT use):**
```javascript
❌ module.exports = [...]
❌ { week: 1, theme: "...", story: "...", grammarFocus: "...", level: "...", tags: [...] }
❌ String concatenation: "Line 1\n" + "Line 2\n" + ...
❌ Single property merging sentences and questions
❌ Story sentences without Japanese translations
❌ Questions WITHOUT Japanese translations (MAJOR ERROR - ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE Japanese)
```

**CORRECT FORMAT (required):**
```javascript
var eiken7aligned = [
  {
    title: "1. Story Title (Theme)",
    content: `😊 Story sentence 1 (3-8 words).
日本語の翻訳1。

😊 Story sentence 2 (3-8 words).
日本語の翻訳2。

[... 8 more story sentences with Japanese translations ...]

🎓 Question 1 in English (3-8 words)?
日本語の翻訳1？

🎓 Question 2 in English (3-8 words)?
日本語の翻訳2？

[... 8 more questions with Japanese translations ...]`
  },
  // ... more stories
];
```

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ Use `var eiken7aligned = [` array format
- ✅ EXACTLY TWO properties per object: `title` and `content`
- ✅ NO other properties: NO week, NO theme, NO grammarFocus, NO level, NO tags
- ✅ Content uses TEMPLATE LITERAL BACKTICKS (` not string concatenation +)
- ✅ **ALL 20 lines with Japanese translations** (one English line, one Japanese line)
- ✅ **Questions MUST have Japanese translations** (Lines 11-20 = questions, each needs Japanese)
- ✅ NO hedging markers, NO discourse markers, NO academic passive (Grade 7 is too simple)
- ✅ NO empty lines within content template literal
- ✅ Lines 1-10: Story sentences
- ✅ Lines 11-20: Discussion questions about THEME (not story comprehension)
