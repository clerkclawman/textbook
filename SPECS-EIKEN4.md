## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Grammar
- ❌ Overusing "will" — focus on "going to"
- ❌ Present perfect — NOT appropriate for this level
- ❌ Complex conditionals — not yet
- ❌ Relative clauses — not yet
- ❌ Inconsistent past time markers

### Vocabulary
- ❌ Low-frequency words — stick to core 600-1,200
- ❌ Abstract concepts — still keep mostly concrete
- ❌ Academic words — not needed yet
- ❌ Too many irregular verbs — master common ones first

### Content
- ❌ Boring chronological lists — make stories interesting
- ❌ Too varied topics — focus on past/future themes
- ❌ Too complex narrative — keep it simple and chronological
