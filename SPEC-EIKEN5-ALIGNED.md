## 1. Level Overview — Grade 5 Summary

### Profile
- **Official Description:** Elementary school level (中学初級程度) — "basic communication"
- **Test Reality:** Present continuous is over-emphasised (36 vs. 30 present simple occurrences)
- **Vocabulary Scope:** 558 unique words (entry-level Eiken)
- **Sentence Length:** 10-12 words average (TV-readable with translations)
- **Proficiency Level:** Beginner elementary — daily life, immediate actions
- **Critical Constraint:** Sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously

### Teach/Test Reality Gap

| Official Description | Test Reality | Impact on Teaching |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Basic communication" | **Present continuous dominant** (36 occurrences) | Focus on "I am doing..." more than "I do..." |
| "Simple English" | **Wh-questions heavily tested** about actions | emphasise question patterns, not just statements |
| "Everyday situations" | **Be-verb questions** (Are you...? Is he...?) central | Teach be-verb questions extensively |

### Core Features — What Actually Gets Tested

#### 1. Present Continuous (DOMINATE FEATURE)

**What the data shows:**
- Present continuous: 36 occurrences
- Present simple: 30 occurrences
- **Exam prefers present continuous over present simple**

**Test evidence:**
- "What are you doing?" over "What do you do?"
- "He is playing tennis" over "He plays tennis"
- Focus on **actions happening NOW**

#### 2. Wh-Questions (Critical)

**Tested extensively:**
- What...? / Where...? / Who...? / When...? / Why...? / How...?
- Focus on questions about immediate actions
- "What are you doing now?" (tested frequently)

#### 3. Be-Verb Questions (Essential)

**Tested heavily:**
- "Are you...?" / "Is he...?" / "Are they...?"
- "Are you a student?" / "Is she your friend?"
- Be-verb in questions is a core skill

### Vocabulary Profile

| Category | Focus Words (Examples) |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Family** | family, mother, father, sister, brother, parents, grandparents |
| **School** | school, teacher, student, class, classmate, desk, chair, book, pen |
| **Daily Routine** | get up, go to bed, breakfast, lunch, dinner, morning, noon, night |
| **Actions** | play, study, eat, drink, go, come, watch, listen, read, write |
| **Feelings** | happy, sad, angry, tired, hungry, thirsty, good, bad |
| **Places** | home, school, park, room, kitchen, bathroom, station, shop |

### Non-Linear Transition: 5級 → 4級

This is the **first major transition point**:

| Metric | 5級 | 4級 | Change | Significance |
|--------|-----|-----|--------|--------------|
| Vocabulary | 558 | 937 | +71% | **Largest vocabulary jump proportionally** |
| Grammar | Present continuous dominant | Past/future introduced | **New features emerge** | Reading passages begin |
| Sentence complexity | Simple structures | Conjunctions appear | Basic complexity introduced | Foundation for upper levels |

**Teaching implication:** 5級 is the entry level but **not "easy"** — present continuous mastery is essential for success.

## 2. Test Reality Summary — What Eiken Analysis Shows

### The Official Description vs. Test Reality Gap

| Official Description | Test Reality | Impact on Teaching |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Basic communication" | **Present continuous over-emphasis** | Teach "What are you doing?" extensively |
| "Simple English" | **Wh-questions central** — 4 key patterns | emphasise question forms, not just statements |
| "Everyday situations" | **Be-verb questions** (Are you...?) | Master be-verb question structures |

### Three Pillars of Grade 5 Success

#### 1. Present Continuous (CRITICAL — The "Now" Tense)

**What the data shows:**
- 5級 tests present continuous more than present simple (36 vs. 30 occurrences)
- Focus on **actions happening NOW**
- Pattern: "I am + [verb]ing" / "He is + [verb]ing" / "They are + [verb]ing"

**Test evidence:**
- "I am playing tennis." (tested frequently)
- "She is reading a book."
- "What are you doing?" (core question pattern)

**Teaching priority:**
- "What is he doing?" (NOT "What does he do?") for current actions
- Distinguish present continuous vs. present simple (NOW vs. HABIT)
- Focus on immediate, observable actions

#### 2. Wh-Questions (TESTED HEAVILY)

**Tested patterns:**
- **What...?** → "What are you doing?" / "What is this?"
- **Where...?** → "Where do you live?" / "Where are you going?"
- **Who...?** → "Who is he?" / "Who are they?"
- **When...?** → "When do you get up?" / "When is it?"
- **Why...?** → "Why are you happy?" / "Why do you like it?"
- **How...?** → "How do you go to school?" / "How are you?"

**Evidence:** Wh-questions account for 40%+ of tested patterns in 5級

**Teaching priority:**
- Question word + be-verb: "Are you...?" / "Is he...?"
- Question word + auxiliary: "Where do you...?" / "What are they...?"
- Questions about actions and states

#### 3. Be-Verb Questions (Foundation Skill)

**Tested heavily:**
- "Are you...?" / "Is he...?" / "Are they...?"
- "Are you a student?" (yes/no question)
- "Is this your book?"
- "Are you happy?" / "Is he tired?"

**Test evidence:** Be-verb questions are 25%+ of tested patterns

**Teaching priority:**
- Master "Are you...?" pattern
- Distinguish "Are you...?" vs "Do you...?"
- Use be-verb questions about states and descriptions

## 4. Story Distribution Table — 48 Stories by Grammar Category

### Distribution Strategy: Fair Rotation (NO PROGRESSION)

All 48 stories at the SAME grade 5 level. Monthly variation provides variety, NOT progression.

### Story Allocation (48 Total)

**PATTERN: Alternating Mixed → Single Focus → Mixed → Single Focus (rotating through all three)**

| Week Type | Grammar Focus | Stories | Percentage | Distribution |
|-----------|---------------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Mixed Grammar Weeks** | All 3 types combined | 24 | 50% | Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47 |
| **Present Continuous Weeks** | PC focus (8-10 instances) | 8 | 17% | Weeks 2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44 |
| **Wh-Question Weeks** | Wh-focus (7-9 instances) | 8 | 17% | Weeks 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46 |
| **Be-Verb Question Weeks** | Be-verb focus (6-8 instances) | 8 | 17% | Weeks 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 |

### Pattern Explanation

**Alternating Rule (Mixed + Focus Rotation):**
- Odd weeks (1,3,5,7...): MIXED (all three grammar types integrated)
- Even weeks (2,4,6,8...): FOCUS (rotating PC → Wh → Be-verb → PC → Wh → Be-verb...)

**Focus Week Rotation:**
- Week 2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44: Present continuous focus (8 weeks)
- Week 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46: Wh-questions focus (8 weeks)
- Week 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48: Be-verb questions focus (8 weeks)

**No Progressive Build-Up — Just Variety:**
- Mixed weeks provide comprehensive practice
- Focus weeks provide concentrated skill development
- Both types maintain Grade 5 level difficulty
- NO progression from "easy" to "hard" — alternating at same level
- EQUAL representation of all three focus types (8 weeks each)

### Grammar Mix Distribution

**In "Mixed Grammar Weeks" (24 stories):**
- Present continuous: 4-6 instances per story
- Wh-questions: 4-6 instances per story
- Be-verb questions: 3-5 instances per story
- All three grammar types integrated naturally

**In "Focus Weeks" (24 stories total):**
- Present continuous weeks: 8-10 PC instances (PC dominant)
- Wh-question weeks: 7-9 Wh instances (Wh dominant)
- Be-verb weeks: 6-8 Be instances (Be-verb dominant)

### Rationale

**Why 50% mixed weeks:**
- Prevents grammar fatigue (doing the same thing for weeks)
- Provides comprehensive practice in natural contexts
- Reflects Grade 5 exam reality (mix of all tested features)
- Avoids artificial isolation of grammar points

**Why 50% focus weeks:**
- Allows concentrated practice on specific tested features
- Mirrors how exams focus on specific patterns
- Provides variety while ensuring all grammar is covered
- Prevents content from feeling "all the same"

**Test Reality Alignment:**
- Eiken exams test all grammar features together
- Students need comfort with mixed grammar
- BUT specific features (present continuous, Wh-questions) ARE tested heavily
- Balance: Mix practice (50%) + feature focus (50%)

## 5. Monthly Progression Schedule — 12 Months × 4 Stories

### Calendar Mapping (CRITICAL Reference)

**Use this table to verify stories match their assigned months:**

| Month | Weeks | Stories | Month Focus | Primary Grammar |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **January** | 1-4 | Story 1-4 | Winter activities, family, new year | PC/Wh/Be-verb mixed |
| **February** | 5-8 | Story 5-8 | School, friendship, daily life | Wh/Be-verb/PC focus |
| **March** | 9-12 | Story 9-12 | Spring, nature, outdoor play | PC/Wh focus |
| **April** | 13-16 | Story 13-16 | School life, classes, teachers | Be-verb description |

| **June** | 21-24 | Story 21-24 | Weather, seasons, summer prep | Wh-questions focus |
| **July** | 25-28 | Story 25-28 | Summer activities, festivals | Present continuous |

| **November** | 41-44 | Story 41-44 | Hobbies, interests, learning | Wh-questions mixed |
| **December** | 45-48 | Story 45-48 | Christmas, winter, celebration | Present continuous |

**Verification Rule:** Each story's theme should align with its month's focus.
- Example: Story 1 (January) should be about winter/family activities
- Example: Story 29 (August) should be about travel/holidays

**Fair Rotation Strategy:**
- ALL grammar types available every month
- For every 4-story batch: Include 3-4 different grammar focuses
- Avoid repeating the SAME grammar focus 4 times in a row

## 7. Writing Guidelines — Sentence Length, Vocabulary, Complexity

### Sentence Length Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**TV-Readable Constraint:** Sentences must be 10-12 words average, maximum 15 words

- "He is reading a book." (Singular + is + reading)
- "They are eating lunch." (Plural + are + eating)
- "What are you doing?" (Question form)

**Present Continuous vs. Present Simple (Teach Distinction):**
- **Present Continuous (NOW):** "I am playing NOW." (happening now)
- **Present Simple (HABIT):** "I play tennis ON WEEKENDS." (routine)

### Wh-Question Guidelines — Core Grammar

**Pattern:** Wh-word + be-verb/auxiliary + subject + main verb

**Examples:**

- **Where...?**

**Pattern:** Be-verb + subject + complement

**Examples:**
- "Are you happy?"
- "Is he your brother?"
- "Are they students?"
- "Is this your book?"
- "Are you hungry?"

**Positive and Negative Answers:**
- Q: "Are you happy?" → A: "Yes, I am." / "No, I'm not."
- Q: "Is he your brother?" → A: "Yes, he is." / "No, he isn't."

- Simple sentences (S-V-O pattern)
