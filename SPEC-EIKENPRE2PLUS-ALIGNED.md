## 1. Level Overview — Pre-2 Plus Summary

### Profile
- **Official Description:** Application of English in practical and academic contexts
- **Test Reality:** **PASSIVE VOICE EXPLOSION (+300%)** — Passive voice in ALL tenses becomes the core differentiator
- **Vocabulary Scope:** 2,111 unique words (14% jump from 準2級's 1,862)
- **Sentence Length:** 16-19 words average. **Note:** This is a TV readability adaptation for simultaneous translations. Actual Pre-2 Plus exams average 7.5 words. Grammar complexity is maintained via passive voice dominance.
- **Proficiency Level:** Upper high school to first-year university — intermediate-advanced
- **Critical Constraint:** Sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously

### Critical Transition: 準2級 → Pre-2 Plus
This is the **3rd major transition point** in the Eiken progression:

| Metric | 準2級 | Pre-2 Plus | Change | Significance |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Vocabulary | 1,862 | 2,111 | +14% | Moderate vocabulary expansion |
| Sentence length | 15-18 words | 16-19 words | +1 word | Gradual length progression |
| **Passive voice** | **5 occurrences** | **20 occurrences** | **+300%** | **THE KEY FEATURE** |
| **2nd conditionals** | Previewed | **Core skill** | NEW | Counterfactual reasoning |
| Modals | 88 (peak) | High usage | — | Continues from 準2級 |

**Note on Sentence Length:** Whilst actual Pre-2 Plus exams use 7.5-word average sentences (from analysis data), this curriculum uses 16-19 words to ensure TV readability with translations. Grammar complexity is maintained through strategic use of passive voice (all tenses) and 2nd conditionals.

### What Makes Pre-2 Plus Different

**Unlike previous levels:**
1. **Passive voice in ALL tenses** — Not just present and past, but perfect and future passive
2. **Academic register introduction** — First exposure to formal academic structures
3. **Counterfactual reasoning** — 2nd conditionals require imagining alternative realities
4. **Reading comprehension depth** — Passages test understanding of complex passive constructions
5. **Implicit meaning inference** — Can infer agent from context when passive omits it

**The "Passive Explosion" Explained:**
- 準2級: Passive voice appears 5 times (minimal, just introduction)
- Pre-2 Plus: Passive voice appears **20 times** (+300% jump)
- This is NOT gradual — it's a massive emphasis shift
- Students MUST master passive in: present, past, present perfect, past perfect, future tenses

## 2. Test Reality Summary — What Eiken Analysis Shows

### The Official Description vs. Test Reality Gap

| Official Description | Test Reality | Impact on Teaching |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Application of English" | **Passive voice explosion (20 occurrences)** | Teach passive in ALL tenses, not just basic forms |
| "Practical and academic contexts" | **2nd conditionals become tested** | Teach counterfactual reasoning systematically |
| "Intermediate English" | **Modals remain high (still dominant)** | Continue modal mastery from 準2級 |

### Four Pillars of Pre-2 Plus Success

#### 1. Passive Voice in ALL Tenses (CRITICAL — THE EXPLOSION)

**What the data shows:**
- Passive occurrences jump from 5 (準2級) → 20 (Pre-2 Plus): **+300%**
- This is the single most significant grammar shift at this level
- Passive voice is tested in: present, past, present perfect, past perfect, future tenses
- Exam passages are DOMINATED by passive constructions

**Test evidence:**
- 準2級: Passive appears minimally (5 occurrences), just introduction
- Pre-2 Plus: Passive is EVERYWHERE (20 occurrences), across ALL tenses
- Students who cannot recognise passive forms will fail reading comprehension

**Passive tenses to master:**
- **Present passive:** *is/are + [verb]ed* — "The research is conducted carefully."
- **Past passive:** *was/were + [verb]ed* — "The study was completed last year."
- **Present perfect passive:** *has/have been + [verb]ed* — "Data have been analysed."
- **Past perfect passive:** *had been + [verb]ed* — "The results had been published before..."
- **Future passive:** *will be + [verb]ed* — "New methods will be implemented."

**When each tense is tested:**
- Present passive: General truths, established facts (*The university is located in Tokyo.*)
- Past passive: Completed actions, historical events (*The building was constructed in 1920.*)
- Perfect passive: Relevance to present (*The study has been referenced repeatedly.*)
- Future passive: Predictions (*The policy will be introduced next year.*)

#### 2. Second Conditionals (NEW FEATURE)

**What the data shows:**
- 2nd conditionals are introduced and TESTED at Pre-2 Plus
- Structure: *If + past simple, ... would + [base verb]*
- Used for: hypothetical situations, counterfactuals, imagining alternatives

**Examples:**
- "If I had more time, I would study harder." (*but I don't have time*)
- "If she lived in London, she would visit museums." (*she doesn't live there*)
- "If they knew the answer, they would tell us." (*they don't know*)

**Critical teaching point:**
- 2nd conditionals describe **UNTRUE** or **HYPOTHETICAL** situations
- Unlike 1st conditionals (*If** I **study**, I **will*** pass*), which describe POSSIBLE situations
- Students must distinguish: 1st conditional (real) vs 2nd conditional (unreal/hypothetical)

#### 3. Modals (Continued from 準2級)

**What the data shows:**
- Modals remain highly tested at Pre-2 Plus (continuation from 準2級's 88 occurrences)
- Core modals: *can, could, should, must, would, might*
- Perfect modals introduced: *could have, should have, would have, might have*

**Perfect modal patterns:**
- *could have + [verb]ed* — "I could have passed the exam (but I didn't)."
- *should have + [verb]ed* — "You should have studied harder."
- *would have + [verb]ed* — "If I had known, I would have helped."
- *might have + [verb]ed* — "It might have been raining."

#### 4. Reported Speech Basics (Supporting Feature)

**What the data shows:**
- Reported speech appears at Pre-2 Plus (not dominant, but tested)
- Basic patterns: *tense backshift, pronoun changes, time/place changes*
- Focus on: reported statements, not complex reported questions

**Basic patterns:**
- Present simple → Past simple: "I **am** happy" → He **said** he **was** happy.
- Present continuous → Past continuous: "I **am studying**" → He **said** he **was studying**.
- Past simple → Past perfect: "I **saw** him" → He **said** he **had seen** him.
- Will → Would: "I **will** go" → He **said** he **would** go.

**Teaching priority:** Report speech is secondary to passive voice and 2nd conditionals. Focus on basic patterns.

### The Teaching Trap

**Current curriculum gap:**
- Many Pre-2 Plus resources treat Pre-2 Plus as "slightly harder 準2級"
- Reality: Pre-2 Plus is a **paradigm shift** to passive voice dominance
- Modal use continues from 準2級, but passive is the NEW core skill
- 2nd conditionals introduce counterfactual thinking (new cognitive pattern)

**Evidence from analysis:**
- Passive 5 → 20 = +300% jump (largest single grammar increase in entire Eiken progression)
- Every reading passage at Pre-2 Plus is passive-HEAVY
- Students who can use active voice but NOT passive will fail comprehension

**Teaching priority should reflect:**
1. **Passive ALL tenses** (present, past, perfect, future) — #1 PRIORITY
2. 2nd conditionals — #2 PRIORITY
3. Modals (continuation from 準2級) — #3 PRIORITY
4. Reported speech (basic) — Supporting feature

1. **Good, readable content** — Most important
2. **Engaging, relatable material** —Humour is ideal when appropriate
3. **Seasonal alignment** — Optional; if included, must align to correct month

**For Pre-2 Plus:** Stories can be about ANY teenage/young adult topic (school, hobbies, friendships, part-time work, travel, technology, etc.). Seasonal events are nice extras when they fit naturally, but should never be forced.

**Content Quality Principles:**
- Better to have excellent non-seasonal content than weak seasonal references
- Humour and engagement are more valuable than seasonal accuracy
- Students learn better when content is interesting and relatable
- Seasonal events create memorable context when used naturally, but not required

### Seasonal Alignment Policy (SIMPLIFIED)

**Seasonal Content: OPTIONAL, Not Required**

Stories may include seasonal references, but this is not mandatory:
- **Primary Priority:** Good, readable, engaging content
- **Secondary Priority:** Humour and wit make content memorable
- **Tertiary Priority:** Seasonal alignment (if relevant to topic)

**When Using Seasonal References:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month:
  - Cherry blossoms: March-April (Japan)
  - Christmas: December
  - Halloween: October
  - Setsubun: February
  - Tanabata: July
  - Obon: August
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Examples of Acceptable Seasonal References:**
- December story about future plans → mentions New Year's resolutions
- April story about new school year → mentions cherry blossoms season
- July story about summer holidays → mentions Tanabata festival or fireworks
- October story about costumes/decorations → mentions Halloween

**Examples of Unforced (Non-Seasonal) Stories:**
- Study habits and test preparation (any month)
- Hobbies like music, sports, gaming (any month)
- Part-time job experiences (any month)
- Friendship dynamics (any month)
- Technology and social media (any month)

**Humour Integration (IDEAL):**
Where appropriate, include subtle wit or humour:
- Relatable school situations (forgotten homework, group project drama)
- Playful commentary on teenage life
- Quirky teacher habits
- Family misunderstandings
- Avoid sarcasm or cynicism — keep it warm and relatable

### Cultural Awareness Guidelines

#### 1. Referencing Multiple Regions without Confusion

**Strategic approaches:**
- **Primary context:** Osaka/Japan (students' direct experience) serves as anchor
- **Secondary comparison:** Brief, explicit references to other regions (1-2 sentences per story)
- **Comparative language:** Use passive voice to describe differences ("In Japan, cherry blossoms are celebrated in spring. In Australia, autumn is experienced during the same season.")
- **Neutral terminology:** Avoid evaluative comparisons; focus on descriptive differences

**Example pattern:**
> "In Japan, cherry blossom season (sakura) in April is celebrated by many people. Hanami parties are held under the trees. However, in Australia, autumn begins during April, and daylight saving time ends. Different seasonal patterns are experienced in each country."

#### 2. International Perspectives for Pre-2 Plus Students

**Why multiple regions matter:**
- Pre-2 Plus students engage with everyday topics that appear in international contexts
- Exposure to diverse cultural contexts broadens cultural awareness and empathy
- International reference points mirror authentic English-language use (often global in scope)
- Intermediate proficiency requires cultural fluency, not just linguistic competence

**Implementation guidelines:**
- **Practical framing:** Present seasonal events as topics relevant to teenagers (holidays, school events, festivals)
- **Authentic references:** Reference actual international holidays, school events, celebrations
- **Teenage applications:** Connect seasonal events to school life, friendship, hobbies, travel
- **Avoid tokenism:** Seasonal references should genuinely support discussion, not be decorative

**Example teenage framing:**
> "Summer holidays are enjoyed by students around the world. In Japan, Obon festival is celebrated in mid-August with family gatherings. In the United States, Independence Day is celebrated on July 4th with fireworks. Different traditions are observed, but summer fun is shared by everyone."

#### 3. Avoiding Cultural Stereotypes while Celebrating Diversity

**Principles:**
- **Specificity over generalisation:** Reference specific festivals or events, not broad "Japanese culture" or "American lifestyle"
- **Authentic representation:** Use accurate details (dates, official names, simple context)
- **Contemporary relevance:** Focus on current practices, not historical or outdated depictions
- **Multiple voices:** Acknowledge diversity within regions (e.g., "Some Australian schools begin in late January, others in early February")

**What to avoid:**
- ❌ "Japanese people love cherry blossoms and always have hanami parties"
- ✅ "Sakura season in Japan typically peaks in early April, with many schools holding entrance ceremonies during this period"

- ❌ "Americans celebrate Thanksgiving with big family meals"
- ✅ "Thanksgiving in the United States occurs on the fourth Thursday in November and is often a time for families to gather together"

- ❌ "Australia is always hot in summer because it's in the Southern Hemisphere"
- ✅ "December marks the beginning of summer in Australia, with many schools starting their summer holidays"

#### 4. Seasonal Relevance by Eiken Level

**Pre-2 Plus vs. Other Levels:**

| Level | Seasonal Focus | Example Themes |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **1級 (Grade 1)** | Academic/professional seasonal contexts | "International education policy conferences coincide with Northern Hemisphere autumn terms" |
| **準1級 (Pre-1)** | University-level seasonal connections | "University application cycles and research publication timing" |
| **2級 (Grade 2)** | Business/workplace seasonal patterns | "Holiday retail sales analysis, quarterly business reviews" |
| **準2級プラス (Pre-2 Plus)** | **School-related & teenage seasonal life** | **School events, holiday studies, part-time work during break periods, family festivals** |
| **準2級 (Pre-2)** | School & personal life | "School trips, daily routines, part-time jobs" |
| **3級 (Grade 3)** | Personal seasonal experiences | "Holiday plans, seasonal activities, school trip descriptions" |
| **4級/5級** | Basic seasonal vocabulary | "It is hot in summer. I like spring." |

**Key distinction:** For Pre-2 Plus, seasonal events connect to teenage life experiences—school events, family festivals, holiday celebrations, part-time work, travel, hobbies. The focus is relatable, everyday contexts teens encounter.

### Seasonal Vocabulary Integration

**Domain-specific seasonal terms for Pre-2 Plus:**

| Seasonal Category | Academic/Appropriate Vocabulary | Example Context |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **School calendar** | semester, term, exam, subject, assignment, project | School life, academic discussions |
| **Cultural events** | festival, celebration, tradition, holiday, ceremony | Cultural topics in passive voice |
| **Seasonal weather** | temperature, rainfall, sunshine, storm, forecast | Weather descriptions with passive |
| **Activities** | travel, holiday, vacation, trip, journey | Personal experiences and plans |
| **Everyday life** | routine, schedule, appointment, meeting, deadline | Daily life with passive structures |

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce seasonal vocabulary within accessible contexts, not as isolated lists. Students should encounter terms in everyday situations, personal stories, and relatable examples where seasonal factors are naturally mentioned.

## 7. Writing Guidelines — Sentence Length, Vocabulary, Complexity

### Sentence Length Requirements (TV-Readable)

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Average sentence length** | 16-19 words per sentence | **TV-readable with translations** |
| **Minimum sentence length** | 14 words | Avoid fragmentation |
| **Maximum sentence length** | 22 words | Strict limit for readability |
| **Sentence length variety** | 14-19 word range | Keep natural flow |
| **Percentage of sentences** (20+ words) | 10-20% | Occasional longer sentences only |

**Critical Constraint:** All sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously. This constraint applies to **all Eiken levels** (5級 through 1级).

**Note:** These targets are for individual sentences (lines 1-10), not total story word count. Each story contains exactly 20 lines.

### Sentence Length Strategy (Maintaining Grammar Complexity)

**How to maintain Pre-2 Plus complexity within TV readability:**

1. **Use passive voice as the primary complexity tool** (this is Pre-2 Plus's signature feature)
   - *Active (simple):* "The teacher explained the lesson." (6 words)
   - *Passive (16 words):* "The lesson was explained carefully to all the students in the classroom." (12 words)

2. **Use 2nd conditionals for counterfactual reasoning**
   - *Simple:* "I don't have time. I can't study." (7 words)
   - *2nd conditional (16 words):* "If I had more time to study, I would prepare for the exam thoroughly." (13 words)

3. **Separate ideas into multiple sentences with appropriate connectors**
   - *Long (23 words):* "Although the research was completed last year, the results have not yet been published because the review process is taking longer than expected."
   - *TV-readable (16 words total):* "The research was completed last year. However, the results have not yet been published." (10 + 7 words)

4. **Use reported speech within TV-readable constraints**
   - *Long (21 words):* "She told me that she had been chosen for the team but she wasn't sure if she could attend the practice sessions."
   - *TV-readable (15 words total):* "She told me she was chosen for the team. She isn't sure about practice." (10 + 5 words)

### Sentence Length Consistency Across Months

| Months | Target Length | Strategy |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| 1-3 | 16-17 words | Simple passive voice (present/past), basic sentence structures |
| 4-6 | 17-18 words | Mixed passive tenses, 2nd conditionals, longer passive sentences |
| 7-9 | 18-19 words | Future passive, perfect modals, reported speech with passive |
| 10-12 | 19 words maximum | Full range of passive tenses, advanced conditionals, relative clauses |

### Vocabulary Level Requirements

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Total vocabulary scope** | 2,111 words | From Pre-2 Plus analysis |
| **Average per story** | 50-70 unique words | New + recycled vocabulary |
| **Academic word family inclusion** | 20-30 AWL words/story | AWL = Academic Word List (introductory level) |
| **Domain vocabulary** | 10-15 terms/story | School, technology, family, travel, hobbies |
| **Passive verb forms** | 8-10 instances/story | **CRITICAL — Passive explosion** |

### Vocabulary Categories by Month

| Months | Domain Focus | Example Domains |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1-3 | School & daily life | Education, routines, hobbies, family |
| 4-6 | Social topics & experiences | Travel, health, relationships, food |
| 7-9 | Media & culture | Technology, entertainment, culture, news |
| 10-12 | Future-oriented topics | Science, environment, goals, dreams |

### Tone and Engagement (IDEAL Quality Factors)

**Primary Tone:** Accessible intermediate-advanced,Teenager-appropriate, warm and engaging

**Humour (Ideal to Include Where Appropriate):**
- Use gentle wit that students will recognise
- Relatable teenage situations (homework stress, friend drama, funny accidents)
- Playful commentary on school life (boring classes, strict teachers, cafeteria food)
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, mocking, or mean-spirited content

**Engagement Characteristics:**
- Relatable situations teenagers experience
- Memorable examples that stick
- Balanced tone: educational but not dry, engaging but not silly
- Humour should be light, warm, and inclusive

**Example Humor Themes:**
- Forgetting homework and making excuses
- Group projects where one person does all the work
- Cafeteria food mysteries
- Teachers who are too strict or too relaxed
- Exam stress and funny study habits
- Social media mishaps

**When to Use Humour:**
- Opening lines can grab attention with a relatable situation
- Examples can be playful and memorable
- Conclusions can warm the tone
- **When to avoid:** Serious topics like bullying, discrimination, tragedy

### Complexity Requirements (Adapted for TV-Readable Sentences)

#### Clause Structure

| Requirement | Target | Example (TV-readable) |
|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Passive sentences** (ALL STORIES) | **8-12 sentences per story** | **MANDATORY — see Section 9** |
| **Complex sentences** (subordinate clauses) | 50-60% of all sentences | Single independent + 1 dependent |
| **Compound sentences** | 20-30% of all sentences | Multiple independent clauses |
| **Simple sentences** | 20-30% of all sentences | Single independent clause |
| **Reported speech sentences** | 2-3 sentences per story (Months 6+) | From X to Y patterns |

**Key Strategy:** Use passive voice as the primary complexity marker at Pre-2 Plus level. The +300% passive explosion means passive sentences should dominate stories.

**Example Transformation:**
- *Before (long):* "Although the university was founded in 1877 and has been expanded several times since then, the original building is still used for important ceremonies today." (24 words)
- *After (TV-readable):* "The university was founded in 1877. It has been expanded several times. The original building is still used for ceremonies." (19 words total, 3 sentences, all passive)

#### Passive Voice Distribution (MANDATORY +300% EMPHASIS)

| Requirement | Target per Story (ALL STORIES) |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| **Total passive sentences** | **8-12 sentences** (**MANDATORY**) |
| **Present passive** | 2-3 sentences (*is/are [verb]ed*) |
| **Past passive** | 2-3 sentences (*was/were [verb]ed*) |
| **Perfect passive** | 2-3 sentences (*has/have been [verb]ed*) |
| **Future passive** | 1-2 sentences (*will be [verb]ed*) |
| **Passive with by-agent** | 1-2 sentences (when appropriate) |

**CRITICAL:** Pre-2 Plus is defined by the PASSIVE EXPLOSION (+300%). Stories MUST feature passive voice dominantly—8-12 passive sentences out of 10 total story sentences.

#### 2nd Conditional Distribution

| Requirement | Target per Story |
|-------------|------------------|
| **2nd conditional sentences** | 2-4 instances (Months 4+) |
| **If + past simple** | 1-2 instances |
| **...would + [base verb]** | 1-2 instances |
| **Mixed conditionals** (past perfect) | 0-1 instances (Months 10+) |

#### Modals Distribution (Continuation from 準2級)

| Requirement | Target per Story |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Modal sentences** | 3-5 instances |
| **can/could** | 1-2 instances |
| **should/must** | 1-2 instances |
| **would/might** | 1-2 instances |
| **Perfect modals** | 0-1 instances (Months 7+) |

#### Reported Speech Distribution

| Requirement | Target per Story (Months 6+) |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Reported speech sentences** | 2-3 instances |
| **Present → Past** | 1-2 instances |
| **Will → Would** | 1 instance |
| **Complex reporting** | 0-1 instance |

#### Discourse Marker Distribution (Supporting Feature)

| Requirement | Target per Story |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Total discourse markers** (optional) | 0-3 instances |
| **Addition markers** | 0-1 instances (*and, also, as well*) |
| **Contrast markers** | 0-1 instances (*but, however*) |
| **Consequence markers** | 0-1 instances (*so, therefore*) |

**Note:** Discourse markers are **secondary** at Pre-2 Plus level. Passive voice and 2nd conditionals are the priorities. Use discourse markers sparingly for cohesion.

### Cohesion and Coherence

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| **Paragraph transitions** | Simple connections (also, moreover, in addition) |
| **Thematic consistency** | One clear topic per story (school, travel, family) |
| **Logical flow** | Simple structure (introduction → main points → conclusion) |
| **Referential clarity** | Pronouns with clear antecedents |

📚 Do you like your school subjects?
あなたは学校の科目が好きですか？
```

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

**Story Sentences (Lines 1-10):**
- Everyday/teenage content about a specific theme (e.g., school life, hobbies, travel)
- Each sentence is 16-19 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Sentences form a cohesive narrative about a relatable topic
- Grammar features: **PASSIVE VOICE DOMINANCE** (all tenses), 2nd conditionals, modals

**Discussion Questions (Lines 11-20):**
- **STAND-ALONE personal discussion questions** anyone can answer from their own knowledge/opinion
- Each question is 16-19 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Questions use **similar grammar/vocabulary** to the story but are about the **THEME**, not the story content
- Questions do NOT require reading the story
- Questions are conversation/discussion prompts for students to give personal opinions

**Example from expected Pre-2 Plus content (School Routine story):**

**Story Sentences (about school daily life):**
```
📚 The lesson is taught by the teacher carefully every day.
先生は毎日注意深く授業を行います。

📖 Homework is assigned to all the students by the class.
宿題はクラスで全ての生徒に課されます。

[... 8 more story sentences ...]
```

**Discussion Questions (about the theme - school and studying):**
```
🎓 Do you think homework should be given to students every day?
あなたは毎日宿題を生徒に出すべきだと思いますか？

📚 Which subject do you find most difficult at school?
学校でどの科目が一番難しいと思いますか？

😄 How do you prepare for important exams?
あなたは重要な試験の準備をどのようにしますか？

[... 7 more questions about school, studying, education ...]
```

**Pattern:** Same format for ALL 20 lines:
```
😊 English sentence OR question (16-19 words).
日本語の翻訳です。
```

**Key Points:**
- Both story sentences AND discussion questions follow the SAME format
- NO empty lines in the story content
- Each story is exactly 20 lines (10 story sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **ALL lines must be 16-19 words** (TV readable constraint)
- Questions are **personal opinion prompts**, NOT reading comprehension tests

### Quality Control Checklist

Before finalizing any story, verify:

#### Grammar Verification

- [ ] **Passive voice count:** 8-12 sentences in Lines 1-10 (**MANDATORY**)
- [ ] **Passive tenses:** Present, past, perfect, future distributed appropriately
- [ ] **2nd conditionals:** Correct *If + past simple, ...would + base verb* structure
- [ ] **Modals:** Appropriate usage (can/could/should/must/would/might)
- [ ] **Reported speech:** Correct tense backshift (*will → would*, *is → was*)
- [ ] **Clause variety:** Not all simple sentences; include passive complex/compound

#### Vocabulary Verification

- [ ] Vocabulary matches Pre-2 Plus level (2,111-word scope)
- [ ] Passive verb forms varied (not repeating same passive verbs)
- [ ] Domain terms accurate to theme
- [ ] No Pre-2 Plus vocabulary gap (too simple for level)
- [ ] No Pre-2 Plus vocabulary overload (not pushing into 2級 territory)

#### Coherence Verification

- [ ] **Passive dominance clearly visible** (Pre-2 Plus signature feature)
- [ ] Theme consistent throughout 10 story sentences
- [ ] Logical flow (sentences connect meaningfully)
- [ ] Referential links clear (pronouns with antecedents)
- [ ] Teenage-appropriate tone (relatable, engaging)

#### Length Verification

- [ ] Average sentence length 16-19 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- [ ] No sentence exceeds 22 words maximum
- [ ] Story contains exactly 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 questions)
- [ ] Word count 50-70 unique vocabulary

#### Exam Alignment Verification

- [ ] **Passive voice dominant** (8-12 sentences per story — reflects +300% explosion)
- [ ] 2nd conditionals tested appropriately (Months 4-12)
- [ ] Modals continue from 準2級 (not diminishing)
- [ ] Reported speech present (Months 6+)
- [ ] Teenage/everyday topics (not overly academic like 1級)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Underusing passive voice** → **PRE-2 PLUS FATAL ERROR** — Must have 8-12 passive sentences per story
2. **Using only present/past passive** → Pre-2 Plus requires ALL tenses (including perfect and future)
3. **Treating Pre-2 Plus as "harder 準2級"** → Pre-2 Plus is PASSIVE DOMINANT, not just "more modal work"
4. **Long sentences** → TV readability constraint: **MAX 19 words average, 22 words maximum**
5. **Missing 2nd conditionals** → This is a NEW feature at Pre-2 Plus, not previewed at 準2級
6. **Overemphasis on modals** → Modals continue from 準2級, but PASSIVE is the NEW priority
7. **Reported speech too early** → Introduce in Months 6+, after passive mastery established
8. **Complex embedding** → Use clearer passive structures instead (TV readability priority)
9. **Academic topics too advanced** → Pre-2 Plus is teenage/everyday, not 1級-level academic
10. **Forgetting by-agent usage** → Include 1-2 passive sentences with "by + agent" when appropriate

## 11. Appendices

### Appendix A: Quick Reference for Writers

### Passive Voice Inventory (PRE-2 PLUS CORE FEATURE)

| Passive Tense | Structure | Stories Allocated | Academic Purpose |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Present passive | *is/are + [verb]ed* | 4 stories | General truths, established facts |
| Past passive | *was/were + [verb]ed* | 4 stories | Completed actions, historical events |
| Present perfect passive | *has/have been + [verb]ed* | 2 stories | Current relevance of past actions |
| Past perfect passive | *had been + [verb]ed* | 1 story | Sequence of past events |
| Future passive | *will be + [verb]ed* | 3 stories | Predictions, scheduled events |
| Passive with by-agent | *[verb]ed + by + [noun]* | 3 stories | Specifying who/what performed action |

**CRITICAL:** Pre-2 Plus is defined by PASSIVE VOICE DOMINANCE. Every story MUST have 8-12 passive sentences out of 10 total story sentences.

### 2nd Conditional Inventory

| Pattern | Structure | Stories Allocated | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Basic 2nd conditional | *If + past simple, ...would + base verb* | 3 stories | Hypothetical situations |
| 2nd conditional with could | *If + past simple, ...could + base verb* | 1 story | Possibility in hypothetical |
| 2nd conditional with might | *If + past simple, ...might + base verb* | 1 story | Lower probability |
| Mixed conditional | *If + past perfect, ...would + have + [verb]ed* | 1 story (Months 10+) | Regret about past |

### Modals Inventory (Continuation from 準2級)

| Modal | Function | Stories Allocated | Frequency |
|-------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| can/could | Ability/possibility | 1-2 stories | Medium |
| should/must | Obligation/recommendation | 1-2 stories | Medium |
| would/might | Hypothetical/probability | 1-2 stories | Medium |
| Perfect modals | *could have, should have, would have* | 3 stories (Months 7+) | Medium-Low |

### Reported Speech Inventory

| Reported Pattern | Original → Reported | Stories Allocated | When Introduced |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Present simple → Past simple | *am/is/are → was/were* | 1 story | Month 3 |
| Present continuous → Past continuous | *am/is/are [verb]ing → was/were [verb]ing* | 1 story | Month 3 |
| Past simple → Past perfect | *[verb]ed → had [verb]ed* | 1 story | Month 6 |
| Will → Would | *will → would* | 1 story | Month 6 |
| Can → Could | *can → could* | 0-1 story | Month 9+ |

### Non-Defining Relative Clauses Inventory

| Clause Type | Structure | Stories Allocated | When Introduced |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Adding information | *[noun], which [verb phrase],* | 1 story | Month 11 |
| Explaining details | *[noun], who [verb phrase],* | 1 story | Month 11 |

### Appendix B: Sentence Structure Examples by Level (TV-Readable)

### Pre-2 Plus Sample Sentences (16-19 words)

**Example 1: Passive Present + Past (Dominant Pattern)**
*"The lesson is taught by the teacher. Homework is assigned every day. The exam was completed yesterday."* (16 words total, 3 sentences, all passive)

**Example 2: 2nd Conditional + Passive Mixed**
*"If I studied harder, I would pass the exam. The test is taken by many students."* (16 words total, 2 sentences)

**Example 3: Perfect Passive + Reported Speech**
*"The results have been published already. He said the study was conducted carefully."* (14 words total, 2 sentences)

**Example 4: Future Passive + Present Passive**
*"The trip will be organised by the school next month. Classes are held every day."* (15 words total, 2 sentences)

**Example 5: By-Agent Passive + Passive Without Agent**
*"The book was written by a famous author. It is read by many students today."* (15 words total, 2 sentences)

---

**Note:** These examples maintain Pre-2 Plus grammar complexity (passive voice dominance, 2nd conditionals, modals) but use 2-3 short sentences instead of 1 long sentence, ensuring TV readability with translations. The passive voice is clearly the dominant feature in every example.

## Appendix: Content Creation Workflow (Required Process)

### Step 1: Create 48-Story Plan Document (MANDATORY First Step)

**Before generating ANY stories, create:**

`TEXTBOOK-PLAN-EIKENPRE2PLUS.md` — Master planning document with:

- All 48 stories outlined (Weeks 1-48)
- Title and theme for each story
- Grammar focus by month (passive dominant rotation pattern)
- Passive tense distribution (present/past/perfect/future)
- 2nd conditional allocation (Months 4-12)
- Modals and reported speech integration
- Passive voice requirement: **8-12 passive sentences per story (MANDATORY)**
- Sentence length requirement: 16-19 words
- Japanese translation requirement: ALL 20 lines

**NOTE:** All 48 stories are at the SAME Pre-2 Plus difficulty level. Monthly changes provide VARIETY, NOT PROGRESSION.

### Step 2: Generate Content Based on Plan

**After plan is complete:**

1. Worker agent generates stories following the plan
2. Reviewer agent checks stories against plan
3. If approved: Save and continue
4. If rejected: Fix, retry

### Step 3: Quality Review and Approval

**Every story MUST pass:**

- [ ] Plan requirements followed
- [ ] Japanese translations on ALL 20 lines
- [ ] Passive voice: 8-12 sentences out of 10 story sentences (**MANDATORY**)
- [ ] All passive tenses represented (present, past, perfect, future)
- [ ] 2nd conditionals used where appropriate (Months 4+)
- [ ] Modals and reported speech integrated correctly
- [ ] Sentence length: 16-19 words (max 22)
- [ ] Teenage-appropriate themes

### Workflow Summary

```
1. Blueprint (SPEC) ✅ Complete
2. Plan (TEXTBOOK-PLAN) ✅ Complete ← FIRST STEP
3. Worker agent → generates stories based on plan (PASSIVE DOMINANCE enforced)
4. Reviewer agent → checks against plan (8-12 passive sentences mandatory)
5. Approval/rejection → proceed or fix
6. Repeat for all 48 stories
```

**Critical Rule:** NEVER generate content without a plan document first. The plan is the single source of truth for what each story must contain.

### NO PROGRESSION Principle (Critical Design)

**All 48 stories are at the SAME Pre-2 Plus difficulty level:**

- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same difficulty level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Monthly Changes = Variety Only (NOT Progression):**

- Different passive tenses for variety (not mastery sequence)
- Different 2nd conditional patterns for variety
- Different topics for variety
- NO "integration phase" or "mastery phase"
- **PASSIVE DOMINANCE IS CONSTANT** — 8-12 passive sentences in EVERY story

This makes infinite content generation possible for a real skill.

### PRE-2 PLUS CORE PRINCIPLE: PASSIVE EXPLOSION +300%

**This is the defining feature of Pre-2 Plus:**

- 準2級: Passive voice = 5 occurrences (minimal)
- Pre-2 Plus: Passive voice = 20 occurrences (+300% jump)
- Curriculum requirement: **8-12 passive sentences per story** (out of 10 total)
- All passive tenses: present, past, present perfect, past perfect, future
- Passive with by-agent: 1-2 sentences per story when appropriate

**Why this matters:**
- Pre-2 Plus exams are passive-HEAVY
- Reading comprehension requires passive mastery
- Students who cannot recognise passive forms will fail
- Official descriptions "application of English" miss this completely

**Teaching implication:**
- Pre-2 Plus is NOT "slightly harder 準2級"
- Pre-2 Plus is a PARADIGM SHIFT to passive dominance
- Every story MUST prioritise passive voice over other features
- 2nd conditionals, modals, reported speech are secondary to passive
