# Eiken Grade 1 — 48-Story Master Plan

**Created:** 23 February 2026  
**Based on:** SPEC-EIKEN1-ALIGNED.md Version 2.6  
**Total Stories:** 48 (4 stories/month × 12 months)  
**Curriculum Duration:** 12 months (48 weeks)

---

## 1. Overview

### Curriculum Summary
- **Total stories:** 48 (Weeks 1-48)
- **Format per story:** 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **Sentence length:** 10-15 words average (TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously)
- **ALL lines (1-20):** Emoji + English (10-15 words) + Japanese translation

**⚠️ CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE: NO PROGRESSION**

**All 48 stories are at the SAME Grade 1 difficulty level.** No progressive building to "mastery."

**Why No Progression:**
- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Monthly Changes = Variety Only (NOT Progression):**
- Fair rotation of ALL hedging types (epistemic, attribution, modal-based, complex)
- Fair rotation of ALL discourse types (addition, contrast, consequence, conclusion)
- Different topics for variety (education, research, AI, climate, economics, etc.)
- NO "integration phase" or "mastery phase"

**Every Single Story (Weeks 1-48) Must Have:**
- Hedging markers: 3-6 instances (flexible range)
- Discourse markers: 4-6 instances (minimum 4)
- Academic passive: 5-8 sentences (MANDATORY)
- Sentence length: 10-15 words (max 20)
- Japanese translations: ALL 20 lines

This makes infinite content generation possible for a real skill — any week can be a student's first or last at Grade 1 level.

### Story Structure
**Lines 1-10:** Story sentences (academic/professional content about a theme)  
**Lines 11-20:** Discussion questions (stand-alone personal opinion prompts about the theme)

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE:** ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS

**Format:**
```
😊 English sentence or question (10-15 words).
日本語の翻訳
```

### Grammar Difficulty Strategy
To maintain Grade 1 complexity within TV-readable 10-15 word sentences, use 2-3 short sentences with discourse markers instead of 1 long complex sentence with deep embedding.

**Example:**
- Long sentence (24 words): *"However, whilst the government has proposed reforms, critics argue that insufficient consultation has occurred."*  
- TV-readable (15 words total): *"The government has proposed reforms. However, critics argue consultation was insufficient."*

### Grade 1 Profile (From Test Reality)
- **Vocabulary:** 5,018 unique words (+41% from 準1级)
-**Hedging/stance markers:** Core differentiator from 準1級
- **Discourse markers:** Foundation from 準1級, continued
- **Academic passive:** Peak usage (52 occurrences)
- **Modals for hedging:** Peak usage (143 occurrences)

---

## 2. Grammar Variety by Month (NO PROGRESSION - FAIR ROTATION)

### Fair Rotation Strategy

**ALL hedging types and discourse markers are available EVERY month.**

No monthly isolation. No "Month X MUST use Type A." Instead:
- Story writers choose from ALL hedging types (epistemic, attribution, modal-based, complex)
- Story writers choose from ALL discourse types (addition, contrast, consequence, conclusion)
- **FAIR ROTATION:** Across 48 stories, ensure ALL types appear regularly and frequently

### Available Hedging Markers (Use Freely)

| Type | Markers | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Epistemic** | arguably, perhaps, ostensibly, apparently, seemingly, likely, presumably | Arguably, this suggests... |
| **Attribution** | reportedly, purportedly, allegedly, supposedly | Reportedly, the study shows... |
| **Modal-based** | may, might, could, would | This may indicate... |
| **Complex** | arguably + reportedly, apparently + supposedly, may + arguably | Arguably, reportedly the data suggests... |

### Available Discourse Markers (Use Freely)

| Type | Markers |
|------|---------|
| **Addition** | moreover, furthermore, in addition, additionally |
| **Contrast** | however, nevertheless, on the other hand, conversely |
| **Consequence** | therefore, consequently, as a result, thus |
| **Conclusion** | in conclusion, to summarise, in summary |

### Fair Rotation Guidance

**For every 4-story batch:**
- Include at least 2-3 different hedging types
- Include at least 2-3 different discourse types
- Avoid repeating the SAME type 4 times in a row

**Example (Weeks 1-4):**
- Story 1: Epistemic hedges + Contrast discourse
- Story 2: Attribution hedges + Consequence discourse
- Story 3: Modal hedges + Addition discourse
- Story 4: Complex hedges + Conclusion discourse

**This ensures variety AND allows writers flexibility.**

---

## 3. Grammar Requirements per Story (CRITICAL)

### Hedging Markers: 3-6 Instances (Flexible Range)
- **Target:** 3-6 instances per story  
- **Focus:** Quality over strict count — use hedges naturally and effectively  
- **Flexible:** 4 or 5 is fine; don't obsess over exact numbers

### Discourse Markers: 4-6 Instances (STRICT MINIMUM = 4)
- **Target:** 4-6 instances per story  
- **Minimum:** 4 discourse markers required (do NOT use fewer than 4)  
- **Maximum:** 6 discourse markers to avoid over-use

### Academic Passive: Lines 1-5 FORCED PASSIVE (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (FIXED FOR RECURRING FAILURE):**

Natural language training makes models prefer ACTIVE voice. Instructions like "include 5-8 passive" are repeatedly ignored.

**SOLUTION: FORCE PASSIVE IN SPECIFIC LINES**

```
Line 1: MUST BE PASSIVE ("was/were [verb]ed" or "is/are [verb]ed")
Line 2: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 3: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 4: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 5: MUST BE PASSIVE

Lines 6-10: Can be ACTIVE or PASSIVE (no restriction)
Lines 11-20: Questions — Can be ACTIVE or PASSIVE (no restriction)
```

**Example (CORRECT):**
- Line 1: The study was conducted at the university. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 2: Data were collected from sources. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 3: Results have been published. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 4: The theory is supported. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 5: Methods are being developed. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 6: Researchers continue work. (ACTIVE ✓ OK)
- Line 7: Funding has been secured. (PASSIVE ✓ OK)

**Result:** Lines 1-5 = 5 PASSIVE MINIMUM (FORCED), requirement met ✅

**Passive Patterns (use these):**
- Past passive: "was/were + [verb]ed"
- Present passive: "is/are + [verb]ed"
- Perfect passive: "has/have been + [verb]ed"

**DO NOT use active in Lines 1-5:**
- ❌ "Researchers conducted the study." (active)
- ❌ "The journal published the research." (active)
- ✅ "The study was conducted." (passive)
- ✅ "The research was published." (passive)

### All Sentences: 10-15 Words Maximum (TV-Readable Constraint)
- **Average:** 10-15 words per sentence  
- **Maximum:** 20 words per sentence (hard limit)  
- **Apply to:** ALL 20 lines (both story sentences AND discussion questions)

### Grammar Complexity Strategy
Use 2-3 short sentences with discourse markers instead of deep embedding:

**Before (too long):** *"Research suggests that studies have shown that evidence supports the view that climate change is accelerating."* (19 words)

**After (TV-readable):** *"Research suggests climate change is accelerating. This evidence is strong."* (9 + 5 = 14 words)

### Academic Passive Examples by Tense
- **Present passive:** *"It is argued that policy reforms are needed."* (general truths)  
- **Past passive:** *"The study was conducted over three years."* (research completed)  
- **Perfect passive:** *"Data have been analysed thoroughly."* (current relevance)  
- **Future passive:** *"Results will be published next month."* (predictions)

| **April** | 13-16 | Story 13-16 | Economics, politics, cultural comparisons |
| **May** | 17-20 | Story 17-20 | Technology, AI, urban studies, media |
| **June** | 21-24 | Story 21-24 | Social policy, migration, sustainability, digital rights |
| **July** | 25-28 | Story 25-28 | Future trends, space, energy, biotechnology |

## 5. Content Quality Guidelines

### Primary Priority: Good, Readable Content
- **Above all:** Stories should be engaging and well-written  
- **Readability:** 10-15 word sentences ensure TV readability with translations  
- **Academic tone:** Professional but not dry, formal but accessible  
- **Topic relevance:** Academic/professional themes (education, research, policy, AI, climate, economics, etc.)

### Secondary Priority: Humour and Engagement
**Use humour where appropriate to make content memorable:**

**Appropriate humour themes:**
- Academic bureaucracy delays and absurdities
- Perfect research plans that inevitably change
- Student procrastination and deadline madness
- Group project dynamics (everyone loves group work)
- Conference presentation anxiety
- Reviewer feedback being politely brutal

**Humour principles:**
- Gentle wit that students will recognise
- Irony about real academic situations
- Playful commentary students relate to
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, mocking, or mean-spirited content

**When to use humour:**
- Opening lines can grab attention
- Examples can be playful
- Conclusions can warm the tone  
- **When to avoid:** Serious topics like inequality, discrimination, tragedy

### Tertiary Priority: Seasonal References (OPTIONAL, Not Required)
**Seasonal content is OPTIONAL — do not force it**

**If using seasonal references:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month:
  - Cherry blossoms: March-April (Japan)
  - Christmas: December
  - Halloween: October
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Better non-seasonal than weak seasonal:**
- ✅ Excellent non-seasonal content about AI ethics  
- ❌ Weak seasonal reference about Christmas in July (forced and confusing)

### Topic Flexibility
**Stories can be about ANY academic/professional topic:**
- Education and research
- Technology and AI
- Climate and environment
- Economics and business
- International relations
- Health and medicine
- Law and policy
- Philosophy and ethics

**Quality principle:** Theme flexibility allows creators to choose topics they can write well about
