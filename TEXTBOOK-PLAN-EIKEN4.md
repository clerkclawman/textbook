# Eiken Grade 4 — 48-Story Master Plan

**Created:** 23 February 2026  
**Based on:** SPEC-EIKEN4-ALIGNED.md Version 1.0  
**Total Stories:** 48 (4 stories/month × 12 months)  
**Curriculum Duration:** 12 months (48 weeks)

---

## 1. Overview

### Curriculum Summary
- **Total stories:** 48 (Weeks 1-48)
- **Format per story:** 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **Sentence length:** 12-14 words average (TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously)
- **ALL lines (1-20):** Emoji + English (12-14 words) + Japanese translation

**⚠️ CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE: NO PROGRESSION**

**All 48 stories are at the SAME Grade 4 difficulty level.** No progressive building to "mastery."

**Why No Progression:**
- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Weekly Changes = Variety Only (NOT Progression):**
- Mixed weeks integrate all three grammar features (Past simple, Future with will, Comparatives)
- Focus weeks emphasise ONE grammar point (Past, Future, or Comparative)
- Different topics for variety (school, hobbies, family, travel, sports, etc.)
- NO "introductory phase" or "advanced phase"

**Every Single Story (Weeks 1-48) Must Have:**
- Past simple: 1-8 sentences (depending on story type)
- Future with will: 0-8 sentences (depending on story type)
- Comparatives: 0-8 sentences (depending on story type)
- Time expressions: 1-5 (Past/Future focus stories require 3-5)
- Sentence length: 12-14 words (max 20)
- Japanese translations: ALL 20 lines

This makes infinite content generation possible for a real skill — any week can be a student's first or last at Grade 4 level.

### Story Structure

**Lines 1-10:** Story sentences (age-appropriate content about a theme: school, hobbies, family, etc.)  
**Lines 11-20:** Discussion questions (stand-alone personal opinion prompts about the theme)

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE:** ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS

**Format:**
```
😊 English sentence or question (12-14 words).
日本語の翻訳
```

### Grade 4 Profile (From Test Reality)
- **Vocabulary:** 937 unique words (+71% jump from 5級 — largest % increase of any transition)
- **Past simple:** Major new feature (36 occurrences in Grade 4 exams)
- **Future with will:** Major new feature (29 occurrences in Grade 4 exams)
- **Comparatives:** Major new feature for Grade 4
- **Sentence length:** 12-14 words (TV-readable with translations)
- **Critical transition:** 5級 → 4級 is the first major grammar transition point in Eiken

## 5. Content Quality Guidelines

### Primary Priority: Good, Readable Content
- **Above all:** Stories should be engaging and well-written
- **Readability:** 12-14 word sentences ensure TV readability with translations
- **Friendly tone:** Encouraging, relatable, simple but not childish
- **Topic relevance:** Age-appropriate themes (school, hobbies, family, sports, travel, etc.)

### Secondary Priority: Humour and Engagement
**Use humour where appropriate to make content memorable:**

**Appropriate humour themes:**
- Funny mistakes while learning
- Playful family situations
- Relatable school moments
- Surprising discoveries
- Gentle situations students will recognise

**Humour principles:**
- Gentle wit that students will recognise
- Irony about everyday situations they understand
- Playful commentary students relate to
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, mocking, or unkind humor

**When to use humour:**
- Opening lines can grab attention
- Examples can be playful
- Conclusions can be encouraging
- **When to avoid:** Serious topics like sadness or disappointment

### Tertiary Priority: Seasonal References (OPTIONAL, Not Required)
**Seasonal content is OPTIONAL — do not force it**

**If using seasonal references:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month:
  - Cherry blossoms: March-April (Japan)
  - Christmas: December
  - Halloween: October
  - Setsubun/Tanabata/Obon: Correct months in Japan
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Better non-seasonal than weak seasonal:**
- ✅ Excellent non-seasonal content about hobbies
- ❌ Weak seasonal reference about Christmas in August (forced and confusing)

### Topic Flexibility
**Stories can be about ANY age-appropriate topic:**
- School and learning
- Hobbies and interests
- Family and friends
- Sports and activities
- Travel and places
- Food and daily life
- Seasonal activities ( optional)

**Quality principle:** Theme flexibility allows creators to choose topics they can write well about

### Workflow Summary
```
✅ Step 1: Plan (TEXTBOOK-PLAN-EIKEN4.md) — COMPLETED
→ Step 2: Generate 48 stories based on plan
   → Worker agent: Create stories following plan
   → Reviewer agent: Verify against plan checklist
   → If rejected: Fix, retry
   → If approved: Save, continue
→ Step 3: Repeat for all 48 stories (Weeks 1-48)

### Critical Rule
**NEVER generate content without a plan document first.**  
This plan (TEXTBOOK-PLAN-EIKEN4.md) is the single source of truth for what each story must contain. All content generation must reference this plan.
