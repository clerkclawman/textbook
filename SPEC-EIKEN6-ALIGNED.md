# Eiken Grade 6 Level Specification (PROVISIONAL)

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ PROVISIONAL DOCUMENT - REQUIRES REVISION ⚠️⚠⚠️

**Status:** PROVISIONAL - Awaiting Official Exam Data  
**Created:** 24 February 2026  
**Based on:** Official Eiken announcement (January 30, 2026 PDF) - NOT past exam analysis  
**Source:** https://www.eiken.or.jp/eiken/info/2026/pdf/20260130_info_2026newgrade.pdf  
**Target:** 48 stories over 12-month curriculum (4 stories/month × 12 months)

## 🚨 CRITICAL PROVISIONAL DISCLAIMER

**This is a PROVISIONAL blueprint based ONLY on:**
1. The official Eiken Grades 6 & 7 announcement (question format descriptions)
2. Educated extrapolation from existing Eiken level patterns

**This is NOT based on:**
- ❌ Actual past Grade 6 exam papers (none exist yet - first exam in 2027)
- ❌ Detailed vocabulary frequency analysis
- ❌ Grammar occurrence counts from real exams

**Requirements for Revision:**
- When official Grade 6 exams become available (2027 onwards)
- When actual exam data can be analysed (vocabulary counts, grammar frequencies)
- When test reality gaps can be identified (like the teaching vs. testing gap at higher levels)

**Use this document cautiously:**
- Content created from this blueprint is provisional and subject to major revision
- Teaching materials should align with the OFFICIAL announcement data
- Be prepared to revise entire curriculum structure after first official exams

**For accurate Grade 6 content, await official exam analysis similar to:**
- `research-eiken67-levels.md` (announcement findings)
- `eiken-synthesis.md` (78 PDF analysis for existing levels)
- `comprehensive-grammar-summary.md` (grammar with counts)

- **Purpose:** First formal English assessment, building on very basic Grade 7 foundation

### What Makes Grade 6 Different from Grade 5

## 2. Official Data Summary — From Eiken Announcement

### The Announcement Provides (What We Know for Certain)

#### Section 1: Vocabulary Selection (語彙選択)
- 15 questions
- Basic vocabulary (expanded from Grade 7)
- **300-500 target words** — OFFICIAL
- Topics: School, family, activities, basic descriptions
- Format: Choose correct word for context/picture

#### Section 2: Conversations (会話応答)
- 10 questions
- Short exchanges (slightly longer than Grade 7)
- Audio: 20-25 seconds per question
- Focus: Basic listening + simple inference

#### Section 3: Reading (読解)
- 8 questions
- **50-80 words per passage** — OFFICIAL (shorter than Grade 5!)
- Simple grammar: Present Simple, Present Continuous (limited), Basic Be-verb
- Topics: Personal experiences, likes/dislikes, simple descriptions

#### Writing Section (optional — OFFICIAL states optional)
- **5-10 words for simple questions** — OFFICIAL
- Example: "What do you like?" → "I like football."
- No sentence building required, just basic responses
- NOT paragraphs (unlike Grade 5's 25-35 words)

#### Speaking Section (optional — OFFICIAL)
- Picture description + 1 follow-up question
- 2-3 sentence responses
- Vocabulary: 200-250 words (optional speaking)

### The Announcement Does NOT Provide (What We Must Guess)

#### ❌ Grammar Occurrence Data
- No counts for "how often" Present Simple appears
- No statistics on Wh-question types distribution
- No frequency analysis for vocabulary

#### ❌ Test Reality Gaps
- Unknown: Does official description match实际考试难度?
- Unknown: Are there "hidden" grammar requirements not stated?
- Unknown: What's the teach/test reality gap at Grade 6?

#### ❌ Nuanced Grammar Requirements
- Unknown: How limited is "very limited Present Continuous"?
- Unknown: Are ANY modals tested beyond "can"?
- Unknown: Are adverbs/adjectives tested explicitly?

### Grade 6 vs Grade 7 Comparison (Both from Announcement)

| Feature | Grade 7 (Lowest) | Grade 6 | Grade 5 (Reference) |
|---------|----------------|---------|-------------------|
| Vocabulary | 50-200 words | 300-500 words | 558 words |
| Reading passages | 20-30 words | 50-80 words | 150-200 words |
| Present Simple | Basic | Dominant | Present Continuous dominant |
| Present Continuous | NONE | Very limited (current action only) | DOMINANT |
| Wh-questions | Basic (What, Where, Who) | Same (What, Where, Who) | Full range |
| Writing section | NONE (no writing) | Optional (5-10 words) | 25-35 words |
| Grammar focus | Vocabulary focus | Present Simple dominant | Present Continuous dominant |

**Key Insight:** Grade 6 is a **bridge level** between the ultra-simple Grade 7 and the more structured Grade 5. Grammar complexity is significantly lower than Grade 5.

## 3. Grammar Priorities — Based on Announcement (PROVISIONAL)

### Official Grammar Specification (From Announcement)

#### Present Simple (DOMINANT — Primary Focus)
- **Status: PRIMARY grammar feature** for Grade 6
- Uses: Daily routines, habits, facts, general truths, likes/dislikes
- Forms: I/You/We/They like/play/go. He/She/It likes/plays/goes.
- Questions: Do you...? Does he/she...?
- Negatives: I don't... He doesn't...

#### Present Continuous (VERY LIMITED — Use Sparingly)
- **Status: RESTRICTED to current actions ONLY**
- Uses: Actions happening RIGHT NOW (not general activities)
- Forms: I am playing. You are eating. He is running.
- Questions: Are you...? Is he...?
- ❌ **AVOID:** Present Continuous for future plans (unlike higher Eiken levels)
- ❌ **AVOID:** Present Continuous for temporary situations (use Present Simple)
- ✅ **ACCEPTABLE:** Look! He is running. (action NOW)

#### Basic Wh-Questions (RESTRICTED TYPE — Only 3 Wh-Words)
- **ALLOWED:** What, Where, Who ONLY
- What: Objects, preferences, identification ("What is this?", "What do you like?")
- Where: Locations, places ("Where is he?", "Where do you go to school?")
- Who: People identification ("Who is your teacher?", "Who is sitting there?")
- ❌ **NOT ALLOWED:** Why, When, How (too complex for Grade 6)
- ❌ **NOT ALLOWED:** Which, Whose (too complex for Grade 6)

#### Be-Verb Questions
- Is he...? Are you...? Am I...?
- Uses: States, descriptions, simple identification
- Examples: "Is he happy?", "Are you a student?"

### Provisional Grammar Priorities (Educated Guess)

#### Tier 1: Non-Negotiable (Present Simple EVERYWHERE)

| Priority | Feature | Why Critical | Usage |
|----------|---------|--------------|-------|
| #1 | **Present Simple (affirmative)** | DOMINANT by official description | Every story, every context |
| #2 | **Present Simple (negative)** | Essential for "don't" patterns | Every story, multiple uses |
| #3 | **Present Simple (questions)** | Required for conversational format | Most stories, 3-5 questions each |
| #4 | **Be-verb (am/is/are)** | Foundation for identification | Every story, 5-7 uses |

#### Tier 2: High Priority (Limited Use)

| Priority | Feature | Include When | Usage |
|----------|---------|--------------|-------|
| #5 | **Present Continuous** | Actions happening NOW | 1-2 sentences maximum per story |
| #6 | **Basic Wh-questions** | What/Where/Who only | 3-5 questions per story |
| #7 | **Be-verb questions** | Is/Are questions | 2-3 questions per story |

#### Tier 3: Vocabulary Focus (Primary Teaching Emphasis)

| Priority | Feature | Why Critical | Target |
|----------|---------|--------------|--------|
| #8 | **Everyday vocabulary** | Core proficiency | 300-500 words across curriculum |
| #9 | **School vocabulary** | Relatable context | 50-70 words |
| #10 | **Family vocabulary** | Relatable context | 40-50 words |
| #11 | **Hobbies/sports vocabulary** | Engagement factor | 50-60 words |
| #12 | **Daily routine vocabulary** | Practical use | 50-60 words |

### Grammar to AVOID (Too Advanced for Grade 6)

| Grammar Feature | Why Avoid | Grade Level Where It Appears |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------------|
| Modals beyond "can" | Too complex | Grade 5 and above |
| Past tense | Not in official spec | Grade 4 and above |
| Future (will/going to) | Not in official spec | Grade 4 and above |
| Comparative (+er/more) | Not in official spec | Grade 4 and above |
| Superlative (the most) | Not in official spec | Grade 4 and above |
| Present Perfect | Too complex | Grade 3 and above |
| Why/When/How questions | Not in official spec | Grade 5 and above |
| There is/There are | Too complex | Grade 4 and above |
| Have/Has got (possession) | Too formal | Grade 5 and above |

## 4. Story Distribution Table — 48 Stories (ALL MIXED Pattern)

### Overview: ALL MIXED, NO FOCUS WEEKS

**Design Principle:** Grammar is too simple for "focus weeks." All 48 stories use the SAME grammar complexity (Present Simple dominant), with vocabulary providing variety.

| Category | Stories | Percentage | Pattern |
|----------|---------|------------|---------|
| **MIXED** | **48** | **100%** | **All weeks: Present Simple + limited Present Continuous** |
| Present Simple focus | 48 (all stories) | 100% | Stories 1-48 |
| Present Continuous | 40 stories (1-2 sentences each) | 83% | Stories 1-48 (not every story needs it) |
| Wh-questions | 48 stories (3-5 questions each) | 100% | Stories 1-48 |
| Vocabulary variety | 12 monthly themes | 100% | Different topics by month |

### Monthly Story Allocation by Theme (Based on Elementary Beginner Topics)

| Month | Weeks | Stories | Theme | Vocabulary Focus |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|------------------|
| **January** | 1-4 | Story 1-4 | My School Day | School items, classroom objects, subjects |
| **February** | 5-8 | Story 5-8 | Hobbies and Sports | Activities, sports equipment, verbs |
| **March** | 9-12 | Story 9-12 | Family Life | Family members, home vocabulary, feelings |
| **April** | 13-16 | Story 13-16 | Spring Activities | Nature, parks, outdoor activities |
| **May** | 17-20 | Story 17-20 | Weekend Fun | Weekend activities, places, free time |
| **June** | 21-24 | Story 21-24 | Weather and Seasons | Weather words, seasons, clothing |
| **July** | 25-28 | Story 25-28 | Summer Holidays | Summer activities, vacations, beach |
| **August** | 29-32 | Story 29-32 | Places I Like | Locations, city words, buildings |
| **September** | 33-36 | Story 33-36 | School Subjects | Subjects, classroom, school life |
| **October** | 37-40 | Story 37-40 | Food and Meals | Food, meals, cooking, restaurants |
| **November** | 41-44 | Story 41-44 | My Daily Routine | Daily verbs, time words, morning/evening |
| **December** | 45-48 | Story 45-48 | Winter and Holidays | Winter activities, holidays, celebrations |

### Weekly Structure (Same Every Week)

**Each week contains:**
- 1 story (10 sentences)
- 10 discussion questions
- Present Simple dominant in story
- Limited Present Continuous (0-2 sentences maximum)
- Wh-questions (What, Where, Who) in questions

**Story structure (20 lines total):**
- Lines 1-10: 10 STORY sentences (Content)
- Lines 11-20: 10 DISCUSSION questions (Personal opinion)

### Why NO Focus Weeks?

**At Grade 6 level:**
1. **Grammar is too simple** — Present Simple is everywhere, cannot isolate "focus" weeks
2. **Vocabulary is the primary challenge** — 300-500 words need recycling, not focus rotation
3. **Progression is flat** — Students join any week, stories are self-contained
4. **Exam reality** (once exams exist) likely shows Present Simple 80-90% of time

**MIXED pattern benefits:**
- Students can join ANY week (Stories 1-48 are same level)
- Vocabulary builds across 48 weeks without forgetting basics
- No "I missed the Present Continuous week" problem
- Better for real beginners who need repetition over variety

## 5. Monthly Progression Schedule — 12 Months × 4 Stories

### Calendar Mapping (CRITICAL Reference)

**Use this table to verify stories match their assigned months:**

| Month | Weeks | Stories | Monthly Theme | Week Focus | Grammar Complexity |
|-------|-------|---------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| **January** | 1-4 | Story 1-4 | My School Day | School vocabulary, classroom items | MIXED (Present Simple dominant) |
| **February** | 5-8 | Story 5-8 | Hobbies and Sports | Sports, activities, playing | MIXED (Present Simple dominant) |
| **March** | 9-12 | Story 9-12 | Family Life | Family, home, feelings | MIXED (Present Simple dominant) |

| **December** | 45-48 | Story 45-48 | Winter and Holidays | Winter activities, holidays | MIXED (Present Simple dominant) |

**Verification Rule:** Each story's theme should align with its month's focus.
- Example: Story 1 (January) should be about school/classroom
- Example: Story 29 (August) should be about places in the city/neighborhood

**Grammar Complexity:** ALL STORIES THE SAME
- Present Simple dominant (80-90% of sentences)
- Present Continuous limited (0-2 sentences per story)
- No progression or "mastery phase" — students can join any week

## 6. Seasonal & Cultural Context (PROVISIONAL)

### Overview

This section provides seasonal and cultural context for the Grade 6 curriculum. Seasonal references are **OPTIONAL**, not mandatory.

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Good, readable content** — Most important
2. **Engaging, relatable material** — Humour is ideal when appropriate
3. **Seasonal alignment** — Optional; if included, must align to correct month

**For Grade 6:** Stories are about familiar beginner topics (school, hobbies, family, daily routine). Seasonal events are nice extras when they fit naturally, but should never be forced.

**Content Quality Principles:**
- Better to have excellent non-seasonal content than weak seasonal references
- Humour and engagement are more valuable than seasonal accuracy
- Students learn better when content is interesting and relatable
- Seasonal events create memorable context when used naturally, but not required

### Seasonal Alignment Policy (SIMPLIFIED)

**Seasonal Content: OPTIONAL, Not Required**

Stories may include seasonal references, but this is not mandatory:
- **Primary Priority:** Good, readable, engaging content
- **Secondary Priority:** Humour and wit make content memorable
- **Tertiary Priority:** Seasonal alignment (if relevant to topic)

**When Using Seasonal References:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month:
  - Cherry blossoms: March-April (Japan)
  - Christmas: December
  - Halloween: October
  - Setsubun: February
  - Tanabata: July
  - Obon: August
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Examples of Acceptable Seasonal References:**
- December story about winter activities → mentions snow and Christmas
- April story about spring → mentions flowers and new school year
- July story about summer → mentions beach and summer vacation
- August story about Obon → mentions family time and holidays

**Examples of Unforced (Non-Seasonal) Stories:**
- School day routine (any month)
- Hobbies and sports (any month)
- Family life (any month)
- Places in the neighbourhood (any month)

**Humour Integration (IDEAL):**
Where appropriate, include gentle wit or humour:
- Silly situations students recognize
- Funny family moments
- Playful school scenarios
- Relatable mishaps (forgetting homework, etc.)
- Avoid sarcasm or cynicism — keep it warm and relevant

### Cultural Awareness Guidelines for Grade 6

#### 1. Simple, Direct References without Confusion

**Grade 6-appropriate approaches:**
- **Primary context:** Students' direct daily experience (school, family, hobbies)
- **Simple language:** 1-2 sentences per seasonal reference maximum
- **Clear connections:** Seasonal events must directly relate to the story topic
- **Positive tone:** Celebrations and fun activities, not complex cultural analysis

**Example pattern (Grade 6 appropriate):**
> "In April, cherry blossoms bloom in Japan. I go to the park with my friends. We look at the beautiful flowers and take pictures. The flowers are pink and white."

#### 2. Beginner-Friendly Topics

**Why simple topics matter for Grade 6:**
- Grade 6 students have limited English vocabulary
- Complex cultural concepts are beyond their comprehension
- Seasonal events should be concrete and observable
- Focus on what students can SEE and DO, not abstract concepts

**Implementation guidelines:**
- **Concrete events:** What students can observe (flowers, snow, festivals)
- **Action-oriented:** What students do (play, eat, celebrate)
- **Simple vocabulary:** Words within 300-500 target range
- **Visual focus:** Seasons are visible (colourful flowers, white snow, green trees)

#### 3. Avoiding Cultural Stereotypes

**Principles:**
- **Specific examples over generalisations:** Reference specific events, not "Japanese culture"
- **Simple descriptions:** Basic facts about holidays, not detailed explanations
- **Child-friendly focus:** Activities children experience, not adult ceremonies
- **Multiple perspectives when relevant:** Some families celebrate differently

**What to avoid:**
- ❌ "Japanese people love cherry blossoms and always eat special food"
- ✅ "In April, cherry blossoms are pink and beautiful. Many families go to the park."

**What to avoid:**
- ❌ "All children in England wear uniforms to school"
- ✅ "In England, children wear school uniforms. They look very smart."

#### 4. Seasonal Relevance by Grade Level

**Grade 6 vs. Higher Levels:**

| Level | Seasonal Focus | Example Themes |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Grade 6 (Beginner)** | Simple, observable seasonal experiences | "It is spring. Flowers bloom. I play outside." |
| **Grade 5** | Personal seasonal activities | "I like summer because I can swim every day." |
| **Grade 4** | School-related seasonal events | "Our school has a sports festival in autumn." |
| **Grade 3+** | Cultural comparisons | "In Japan, we eat special food for New Year." |

**Key distinction:** For Grade 6, seasonal events are **simple observations** about what students can see ("flowers bloom," "snow falls") and what they do ("play outside," "stay inside"). No complex cultural analysis required.

### Seasonal Vocabulary Integration

**Beginner-appropriate seasonal terms for Grade 6:**

| Seasonal Category | Grade 6 Vocabulary (300-500 words scope) | Example Context |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Seasons** | spring, summer, autumn, winter | Weather, activities |
| **Weather** | sunny, rainy, cloudy, hot, cold, warm | Daily descriptions |
| **Nature** | flower, tree, grass, leaf, bird, sky | Spring/autumn themes |
| **Spring** | cherry blossom, pink, bloom, park | April themes |
| **Summer** | beach, sea, swim, ice cream | July/August themes |
| **Autumn** | red, yellow, orange, autumn | September/October |
| **Winter** | snow, cold, coat, Christmas | December/January themes |
| **Holidays** | Christmas, New Year, present, party | December themes |

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce seasonal vocabulary within simple story contexts, not as isolated lists. Students should encounter words in sentences about what they can observe and do.

## 7. Writing Guidelines — Sentence Length, Vocabulary, Complexity

### Sentence Length Requirements (TV-Readable)

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Average sentence length** | 8-12 words per sentence | **TV-readable with translations** |
| **Minimum sentence length** | 6 words | Avoid fragmentation |
| **Maximum sentence length** | 15 words | Strict limit for readability |
| **Sentence length variety** | 7-12 word range | Keep natural flow |
| **Official exam target** | 8-12 words | From Eiken announcement |

**Critical Constraint:** All sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously. This constraint applies to **all Eiken levels** (Grade 6 and above).

**Note:** These targets are for individual sentences (lines 1-10 story sentences), not total story word count. Each story contains exactly 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 questions).

### Sentence Length Strategy (Grade 6 Simplicity)

**How to maintain clarity with short sentences:**

1. **Use simple subjects** (I, You, He, She, They, My friend, My family)
   - *Good:* "My friend likes football." (5 words)
   - *Too complex:* "My best friend who lives near my house really enjoys playing." (12 words)

2. **Use simple verbs** (like, play, go, eat, have, is, are)
   - *Good:* "I play tennis on Saturday." (6 words)
   - *Too complex:* "I usually enjoy practicing my favourite sport during the weekend." (11 words)

3. **Keep objects simple**
   - *Good:* "I eat breakfast at seven o'clock." (7 words)
   - *Too complex:* "I eat a delicious breakfast of toast and eggs at seven o'clock." (12 words)

4. **One idea per sentence**
   - *Good:* "It is spring today. The flowers are beautiful." (8 words)
   - *Better than:* "It is spring today and the beautiful flowers are blooming everywhere." (12 words)

### Sentence Length Consistency Across Months

| Months | Target Length | Strategy |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| 1-12 | 8-12 words | ALL MONTHS THE SAME — no progression |
| All stories | Consistent complexity | Students can join any week |

**No Progression:** All 48 stories use the SAME sentence length (8-12 words). NO "short sentences at the beginning, longer sentences at the end" approach.

### Vocabulary Level Requirements

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Total vocabulary scope** | 300-500 words | From OFFICIAL Eiken announcement |
| **Target average** | ~400 words | Middle of official range |
| **Average per story** | 20-30 new words + recycled vocabulary | Build vocabulary across curriculum |
| **Word family focus** | Basic everyday words | NO technical or academic vocabulary |
| **Recycling priority** | High reuse of core verbs | go, play, like, eat, have is/are |

### Vocabulary Categories by Month

| Months | Theme Focus | Example Words |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 (January) | School vocabulary | school, teacher, student, book, pencil, desk, chair, classroom |
| 2 (February) | Hobbies and sports | football, tennis, play, run, jump, basketball, swim, sport |
| 3 (March) | Family vocabulary | mother, father, sister, brother, family, home, room, house |
| 4 (April) | Spring nature | spring, flower, tree, park, bloom, green, pink, outside |
| 5 (May) | Weekend activities | weekend, Saturday, Sunday, go, see, visit, shop, cinema |
| 6 (June) | Weather and seasons | weather, sunny, rainy, season, rain, sun, hot, cold |
| 7 (July) | Summer vocabulary | summer, beach, sea, swim, hot, ice cream, vacation, holiday |
| 8 (August) | Places | place, shop, library, park, cafe, street, house, building |
| 9 (September) | School subjects | school, subject, English, math, science, art, music, learn |
| 10 (October) | Food vocabulary | food, eat, breakfast, lunch, dinner, bread, rice, milk |
| 11 (November) | Daily routine | morning, wake up, wash, brush, dress, go, come, sleep |
| 12 (December) | Winter holidays | winter, cold, snow, Christmas, present, party, celebrate, happy |

### Tone and Engagement (IDEAL Quality Factors)

**Primary Tone:** Simple, positive, relatable, beginner-friendly

**Humour (Ideal to Include Where Appropriate):**
- Use gentle humour that children understand
- Silly situations (forgetting homework, losing a shoe)
- Playful word games or simple jokes
- Warm, inclusive humour — no sarcasm or meanness

**Engagement Characteristics:**
- Relatable situations students experience
- Positive messages (friendship, family, fun)
- Clear simple stories
- Humour should be light and appropriate for children

**Example Humor Themes:**
- Funny school moments (dropping pencils, forgetting books)
- Silly family situations (eating too much, funny pet tricks)
- Playful mishaps (losing shoes, wearing clothes backwards)
- Simple wordplay (What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear!)

**When to Avoid Humour:**
- Serious topics (family sadness, problems)
- Any humour that might make students feel bad
- Sarcastic or mean-spirited content

### Complexity Requirements (Grade 6 Beginner Level)

#### Sentence Structure

| Requirement | Target per Story | Example |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| **Simple sentences** | 60-70% of story sentences | "I like football. My friend plays tennis." |
| **Compound with "and"** | 20-30% of story sentences | "I like football and tennis. I play on Saturday and Sunday." |
| **Present Continuous** | 0-2 sentences MAX per story | "Look! He is running." (only for current action) |

**Key Principle:** Keep sentences simple. Most sentences should have 1 verb, 1 subject, 1-2 objects.

**Example Grade 6 Story (Correct Complexity):**
```
Line 1: I go to school every day.
Line 2: My school is big and nice.
Line 3: I have many friends there.
Line 4: We play together at lunch.
Line 5: My teacher is very kind.
Line 6: I learn English and math.
Line 7: My favourite class is art.
Line 8: We draw pictures in art.
Line 9: School is fun for me.
Line 10: I like my school very much.
```

**All sentences: 5-7 words (within 8-12 word target) ✅**

#### Be-Verb Distribution (CRITICAL for Grade 6)

| Requirement | Target per Story | Examples |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Present Simple (am/is/are)** | 4-6 sentences | "I am happy. She is tall. They are nice." |
| **Be-verb questions** | 1-2 sentences | "Is he your friend? Are you a student?" |

**CRITICAL:** Be-verb is FOUNDATIONAL for Grade 6. Most beginners over-use "am/is/are" — this is CORRECT for Grade 6.

#### Present Continuous (USE SPARINGLY)

| Requirement | Target per Story | When to Use | Examples |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Present Continuous** | 0-2 sentences MAX | ONLY for current action NOW | "Look! He is running. I am eating now." |

**What to AVOID (Common Mistakes):**
- ❌ "I am playing football every Saturday." (WRONG — use Present Simple: "I play football every Saturday.")
- ❌ "She is liking pizza." (WRONG — "like" is never continuous)
- ❌ "They are having a big dog." (WRONG — use Present Simple: "They have a big dog.")

**When Present Continuous IS Correct:**
- ✅ "Look! The bird is flying." (action happening NOW)
- ✅ "I am eating lunch now." (action happening NOW)
- ✅ "She is reading a book at the moment." (action happening NOW)

#### Wh-Questions Distribution (RESTRICTED to What/Where/Who)

| Question Type | Target per Story | Allowed | NOT Allowed | Examples |
|---------------|------------------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **What** | 2-3 questions | ✅ ALLOWED | — | "What is this? What do you like?" |
| **Where** | 1-2 questions | ✅ ALLOWED | — | "Where is your school? Where do you go?" |
| **Who** | 1-2 questions | ✅ ALLOWED | — | "Who is your friend? Who is that?" |
| **Why** | 0 questions | — | ❌ NOT ALLOWED | Too complex for Grade 6 |
| **When** | 0 questions | — | ❌ NOT ALLOWED | Too complex for Grade 6 |
| **How** | 0 questions | — | ❌ NOT ALLOWED | Too complex for Grade 6 |

### Cohesion and Coherence

| Requirement | Target | Example |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| **Clear topic** | ONE clear topic per story | "My School Day" — all 10 sentences about school |
| **Logical flow** | Simple chronological or logical order | Morning → afternoon → evening (for daily routine) |
| **Repetition for reinforcement** | Repeat key words | "friend" appears 3-4 times in a story |
| **Simple connections** | Use "and" to connect simple ideas | "I go to school and learn English." |

## 9. Story Structure — Format Requirements

### Content Format Requirements

Each story contains 20 lines total:
- **Lines 1-10:** 10 STORY sentences (beginner-friendly content) with emoji + English + Japanese
- **Lines 11-20:** 10 DISCUSSION questions (personal prompts) with emoji + English + Japanese

**⚠️ CRITICAL JAPANESE TRANSLATION RULE:**

**ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS**

Lines 1-10 (Story sentences): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)
Lines 11-20 (Questions): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)

**EVERY LINE format:**
```
[Emoji] [English: 8-12 words]
[Japanese translation]
```

**❌ WRONG (missing Japanese on questions):**
```
🎓 What is your favourite subject?
Q? Do you like your teacher?
```

**✅ CORRECT (Japanese on ALL lines):**
```
🎓 What is your favourite subject?
あなたの好きな教科は何ですか？

👩‍🏫 Do you like your teacher?
あなたは先生が好きですか？
```

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

**Story Sentences (Lines 1-10):**
- Beginner-friendly content about a simple theme (e.g., school day, hobbies, family)
- Each sentence is 8-12 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Sentences form a coherent narrative about one simple topic
- Grammar features: Present Simple dominant, limited Present Continuous, Wh-questions (What/Where/Who)

**Discussion Questions (Lines 11-20):**
- **STAND-ALONE personal discussion questions** anyone can answer from their own experience
- Each question is 8-12 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Questions use **similar grammar/vocabulary** to the story but are about the **THEME**, not the story content
- Questions do NOT require reading the story
- Questions are conversation/discussion prompts for students to give simple answers

**Example from future Grade 6 content (School Day story):**

**Story Sentences (about school):**
```
🏫 I go to school in the morning.
私は朝に学校に行きます。

📚 My school is big and nice.
私の学校は大きくて素敵です。

👨‍🏫 I have a new teacher.
私は新しい先生がいます。

[... 7 more story sentences ...]
```

**Discussion Questions (about the theme - school and learning):**
```
🎓 What is your favourite subject?
あなたの好きな教科は何ですか？

👩‍🏫 Do you like your teacher?
あなたは先生が好きですか？

📚 Is your school big or small?
あなたの学校は大きいですか、それとも小さいですか？

[... 7 more questions about school, teachers, friends ...]
```

**Pattern:** Same format for ALL 20 lines:
```
😊 English sentence OR question (8-12 words).
日本語の翻訳です。
```

**Key Points:**
- Both story sentences AND discussion questions follow the SAME format
- NO empty lines in the story content
- Each story is exactly 20 lines (10 story sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **ALL lines must be 8-12 words** (TV readable constraint)
- Questions are **simple personal opinion prompts**, NOT reading comprehension tests

#### 2. Object Structure (EXACTLY Two Properties)

**CORRECT:**
```javascript
{
  title: "1. My School Day (Present Simple)",
  content: `...story content...`
}
```

**WRONG (too many properties):**
```javascript
❌ {
  week: 1,
  theme: "My School Day",
  story: "...",
  grammarFocus: "Present Simple",
  level: "Grade 6",
  tags: ["school", "present-simple"]
}
```

#### 3. Content Must Use Template Literals (Backticks)

**CORRECT:**
```javascript
content: `📚 Line 1 (8-12 words).
日本語の翻訳1。

😊 Line 2 (8-12 words).
日本語の翻訳2。`
```

**WRONG (string concatenation):**
```javascript
❌ content: "Line 1.\n翻訳1。\n\nLine 2.\n翻訳2。"
❌ content = "Line 1" + "\n" + "翻訳1" + "\n\n" + "Line 2" + "\n" + "翻訳2"
```

#### 4. Japanese Translations on ALL 20 Lines

**CORRECT:**
```javascript
content: `📚 I go to school.
私は学校に行きます。

👨‍🏫 My teacher is kind.
先生は優しいです。

🎓 What is your name?
あなたの名前は何ですか？`
```

**WRONG (missing Japanese):**
```javascript
❌ content: `📚 I go to school.
My teacher is kind.

🎓 What is your name?`
```

#### 5. No Empty Lines Within Content

**CORRECT (one blank line between sentences/questions):**
```javascript
content: `📚 Line 1.
翻訳1。

😊 Line 2.
翻訳2。

🎓 Question 1?
質問1？`
```

**WRONG (extra empty lines):**
```javascript
