# Eiken Grade 6 — 48-Story Master Plan

**Created:** 24 February 2026  
**Based on:** SPEC-EIKEN6-ALIGNED.md Version 1.0  
**Total Stories:** 48 (4 stories/month × 12 months)  
**Curriculum Duration:** 12 months (48 weeks)

---

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL DISCLAIMER: THIS IS PROVISIONAL ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**STATUS: PROVISIONAL — AWAITING OFFICIAL EXAM DATA**

This plan is based ONLY on:
- ✅ Official Eiken announcement (January 30, 2026 PDF)
- ✅ Educated extrapolation from existing Eiken level patterns

This is NOT based on:
- ❌ Actual past Grade 6 exam papers (none exist yet — first exam in 2027)
- ❌ Detailed vocabulary frequency analysis from real exams
- ❌ Grammar occurrence counts from actual test data

**When official Grade 6 exams become available (2027 onwards):**
- This entire curriculum may require major revision
- Grammar priorities may change based on test reality
- Vocabulary scope may need adjustment
- Grammar distribution may need recalibration

**Use this plan cautiously:**
- Content created from this blueprint is provisional and subject to revision
- Teaching materials should align with OFFICIAL announcement data
- Be prepared to revise after first official exams are analysed

**For accurate Grade 6 content production:**
- Awaiting exam analysis similar to existing levels (eiken-synthesis.md)
- Awaiting grammar occurrence data from real exams
- Awaiting test reality gap identification (teaching vs. testing at Grade 6)

## 1. Overview

### Curriculum Summary
- **Total stories:** 48 (Weeks 1-48)
- **Format per story:** 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **Sentence length:** 8-12 words average (TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously)
- **ALL lines (1-20):** Emoji + English (8-12 words) + Japanese translation

**⚠️ CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE: NO PROGRESSION**

**All 48 stories are at the SAME Grade 6 difficulty level.** No progressive building to "mastery."

**Why No Progression:**
- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Monthly Changes = VARIETY ONLY (NOT Progression):**
- Different themes for variety (school, hobbies, family, seasons, etc.)
- Same grammar pattern every week (Present Simple dominant)
- Vocabulary provides variety, not grammar complexity
- NO "mastery phase" or "integration phase"

**Every Single Story (Weeks 1-48) Must Have:**
- Present Simple: 8-10 sentences (dominant pattern)
- Be-verb (am/is/are): 4-6 sentences
- Present Continuous: 0-2 sentences MAX (current action ONLY)
- Basic Wh-questions: What, Where, Who ONLY
- Sentence length: 8-12 words average (TV-readable)
- Japanese translations: ALL 20 lines

This makes infinite content generation possible for beginners — any week can be a student's first or last at Grade 6 level.

### Story Structure
**Lines 1-10:** Story sentences (beginner content about a simple, relatable theme)  
**Lines 11-20:** Discussion questions (stand-alone personal prompts about the theme)

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE:** ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS

**Format:**
```
😊 English sentence or question (8-12 words).
日本語の翻訳
```

### Grade 6 Profile (From Official Announcement)
- **Official Description:** Introductory level for beginners, late elementary students
- **Official CEFR Equivalent:** A1 (very basic)
- **Test Reality:** UNKNOWN — NO EXAMS YET (based on announcement only)
- **Vocabulary Scope:** 300-500 words (target ~400 average) — from OFFICIAL announcement
- **Sentence Length:** 8-12 words average — from OFFICIAL announcement
- **Reading Passages:** 50-80 words (5-8 sentences) — from OFFICIAL announcement
- **Writing:** 5-10 words (simple answers, not paragraphs) — from OFFICIAL announcement
- **Age Target:** Late elementary beginners (Grades 4-6 in Japanese system)
- **Proficiency Level:** Very basic English foundations
- **Critical Constraint:** Sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously

### Grammar Pattern: MIXED (No Monthly Progression)

**ALL 48 WEEKS: SAME PATTERN**

| Grammar Feature | Frequency per Story | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Present Simple | 8-10 sentences | DOMINANT — every story |
| Be-verb (am/is/are) | 4-6 sentences | Foundational beginner pattern |
| Present Continuous | 0-2 sentences MAX | ONLY for current action NOW |
| Wh-questions | 3-5 questions | What, Where, Who ONLY |
| Be-verb questions | 1-2 sentences | Is/Are questions |

**What to AVOID (Too Advanced for Grade 6):**
- ❌ Modals beyond "can"
- ❌ Past tense (any form)
- ❌ Future tense (will/going to)
- ❌ Why, When, How questions
- ❌ Present Perfect
- ❌ Comparative/Superlative
- ❌ Relative clauses
- ❌ There is/There are

### Level Context: Grade 6 in the Eiken Hierarchy

**Level Order (lowest to highest):**
- Grade 7 (NEW, lowest) — 50-200 words, Be-verb only
- **Grade 6 (NEW, this level)** — 300-500 words, Present Simple dominant
- Grade 5 (existing) — 558 words, Present Continuous dominant

**Where Grade 6 fits:**
- **Between Grade 7 and Grade 5** — bridging level, but simpler than Grade 5
- **Age target:** Late elementary beginners (Grades 4-6)
- **Purpose:** First formal English assessment, building on very basic Grade 7 foundation

### What Makes Grade 6 Different from Grade 5

| Feature | Grade 6 (NEW) | Grade 5 (Existing) | Difference |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| Vocabulary | 300-500 words | 558 words | ~15% smaller |
| Reading passages | 50-80 words | 150-200 words | **3x shorter** |
| Present Continuous | Very limited (current action ONLY) | DOMINANT (36+ occurrences) | **Much less** |
| Wh-questions | Basic (What, Where, Who) | Full range (including Why, When, How) | **Simpler** |
| Writing | 5-10 words (single answers) | 25-35 words (paragraphs) | **Much shorter** |
| Grammar focus | Present Simple dominant | Present Continuous dominant | **Different emphasis** |

## 2. Monthly Grammar Focus Table

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL MONTHS HAVE SAME GRAMMAR PATTERN

**NO PROGRESSION — MIXED PATTERN EVERY MONTH**

| Month | Weeks | Grammar Pattern | Present Simple | Present Continuous | Wh-Questions | Sentence Length |
|-------|-------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **January** | 1-4 | MIXED | 8-10 sentences | 0-2 sentences MAX | What, Where, Who | 8-12 words avg |

| **December** | 45-48 | MIXED | 8-10 sentences | 0-2 sentences MAX | What, Where, Who | 8-12 words avg |

### Explanation: Why MIXED Pattern ALL YEAR?

**At Grade 6 beginner level:**

1. **Grammar is too simple for "focus weeks"**
   - Present Simple is everywhere, cannot isolate "focus" weeks
   - No natural progression like higher Eiken levels
   - Students need consistent reinforcement, not variety of grammar patterns

2. **Vocabulary is the primary challenge**
   - 300-500 words need recycling across 48 weeks
   - Students benefit from seeing core verbs (go, play, like, eat) repeatedly
   - Monthly themes provide vocabulary variety without grammar complexity

3. **Progression is flat by design**
   - Students can join ANY week (Stories 1-48 are same level)
   - No "I missed the Present Continuous week" problem
   - Each story is self-contained

4. **Exam reality (once exams exist) will show simple grammar**
   - Present Simple likely 80-90% of exam sentences
   - Present Continuous very limited (current action only)
   - No need for complex monthly rotation patterns

**Benefits of MIXED Pattern:**
- Students can start ANY week
- Vocabulary builds without forgetting basics
- Consistent reinforcement of Present Simple
- Better for real beginners who need repetition

## 7. Sentence Length and TV Readability

### Sentence Length Requirements

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Average sentence length** | 8-12 words per sentence | **TV-readable with translations** |
| **Minimum sentence length** | 6 words | Avoid fragmentation |
| **Maximum sentence length** | 15 words | Strict limit for readability |
| **Sentence length variety** | 7-12 word range | Keep natural flow |
| **Official exam target** | 8-12 words | From Eiken announcement |

**CRITICAL Constraint:** All sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously. This applies to ALL 20 lines (story sentences + discussion questions).

### How to Maintain Clarity with Short Sentences

1. **Use simple subjects** (I, You, He, She, They, My friend, My family)
   - ✅ Good: "My friend likes football." (5 words)
   - ❌ Too complex: "My best friend who lives near my house really enjoys playing." (12 words)

2. **Use simple verbs** (like, play, go, eat, have, is, are)
   - ✅ Good: "I play tennis on Saturday." (6 words)
   - ❌ Too complex: "I usually enjoy practicing my favourite sport during the weekend." (11 words)

3. **Keep objects simple**
   - ✅ Good: "I eat breakfast at seven o'clock." (7 words)
   - ❌ Too complex: "I eat a delicious breakfast of toast and eggs at seven o'clock." (12 words)

4. **One idea per sentence**
   - ✅ Good: "It is spring today. The flowers are beautiful." (8 words)
   - ❌ Better than: "It is spring today and the beautiful flowers are blooming everywhere." (12 words)

### Sentence Length Consistency

**All 48 stories have the SAME sentence length requirement — NO PROGRESSION:**

- Average: 8-12 words per sentence
- Maximum: 15 words per sentence

## 9. Content Quality Guidelines

### Primary Priority: Good, Readable Content

**Above all:** Stories should be engaging and well-written

- **Readability:** 8-12 word sentences ensure TV readability with translations
- **Simple tone:** Beginner-friendly, warm, encouraging
- **Topic relevance:** Elementary beginner topics (school, hobbies, family, daily routine)
- **Relatable content:** Stories should match students' actual experiences

### Secondary Priority: Humour and Engagement

**Use humour where appropriate to make content memorable:**

**Appropriate humour themes for Grade 6:**
- Silly school situations (dropping pencils, forgetting homework)
- Funny family moments (eating too much, funny pet tricks)
- Playful mishaps (losing a shoe, wearing clothes backwards)
- Simple wordplay appropriate for children

**Humour principles:**
- Gentle wit that children will understand
- Irony about real situations students recognize
- Playful commentary students relate to
- **AVOID:** Sarcasm, cynicism, mocking, or mean-spirited content

**When to use humour:**
- Opening lines can grab attention
- Examples can be playful
- Conclusions can warm the tone
- **When to avoid:** Serious topics or situations that might make students feel bad

### Tertiary Priority: Seasonal References (OPTIONAL, Not Required)

**Seasonal content is OPTIONAL — do not force it**

**If using seasonal references:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month:
  - Cherry blossoms: March-April (Japan)
  - Christmas: December
  - Halloween: October
  - Setsubun: February
  - Tanabata: July
  - Obon: August
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Better non-seasonal than weak seasonal:**
- ✅ Excellent non-seasonal content about school day
- ❌ Weak seasonal reference about Christmas in July (forced and confusing)

### Topic Flexibility

**Stories can be about ANY elementary beginner topic:**
- School life (classroom, subjects, friends)
- Hobbies and sports (playing, activities)
- Family life (family members, home, helping)
- Nature and seasons (weather, outdoor play)
- Food and meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- Daily routine (morning, school, after school, evening)

**Quality principle:** Theme flexibility allows creators to choose topics they can write well about

## Final Reminder: PROVISIONAL STATUS

**This plan is PROVISIONAL and subject to major revision:**

1. **Based on announcement only** — No actual exam data yet (first Grade 6 exam in 2027)
2. **Grammar priorities may change** — Real exam data may reveal different patterns
3. **Vocabulary scope may need adjustment** — Official analysis may provide more precise targets
4. **Be prepared to revise** — After first official exams are available and analysed

**For accurate Grade 6 content production:**
- Await exam analysis data similar to existing levels
- Await grammar occurrence statistics from real exams
- Await vocabulary frequency analysis
- Await test reality gap identification

**Use this plan cautiously** as a starting point for provisional content creation, but be prepared to revise curriculum structure extensively when official exam data becomes available.
