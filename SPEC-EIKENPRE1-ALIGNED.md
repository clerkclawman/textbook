## 1. Level Overview — Pre-1 Summary

### Profile
- **Official Description:** Bridge to university — academic and professional situations
- **Test Reality:** **Discourse markers are THE secret** for academic coherence; academic register with emphasis on logical flow and argument structure
- **Vocabulary Scope:** 3,613 words (49% jump from 2級's 2,447)
- **Sentence Length:** 22-28 words (textbook uses 10-15 words for TV readability with translations)
- **Proficiency Level:** University intermediate — academic reading and writing foundations
- **Critical Constraint:** Sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously

### Critical Transition: 2級 → 準1級

This is the **4th major transition point** in the Eiken progression:

| Metric | 2級 | 準1級 | Change | Significance |
|--------|-----|--------|--------|--------------|
| Vocabulary | 2,447 | 3,613 | +49% | Massive vocabulary expansion |
| Sentence length | 18-22 words | 22-28 words | +22% | Move to academic structure |
| **Discourse markers** | Basic | **ESSENTIAL** | NEW | **THE key tested feature** |
| Academic register | Limited | Required | NEW | Formal writing conventions |
| Inversion/Ellipsis | Rare | Tested | NEW | Stylistic variety |
| Modals | High usage | Very High | +25% | Continued modal strength |

**Note on Sentence Length:** Whilst actual Pre-1 exams use 22-28 word sentences, this curriculum uses 10-15 words to ensure TV readability with translations. Grammar complexity is maintained through strategic use of discourse markers, academic register, and multiple short sentences connected with logical flow.

### What Makes Pre-1 Different

**Unlike previous levels:**
1. **Discourse markers are non-negotiable** — Without them, academic writing fails
2. **Logical coherence is tested** — Ideas must connect explicitly
3. **Academic register emerges** — Formal tone, objective language
4. **Multiple-paragraph reading** — Students read extended academic passages
5. **Argument structure matters** — Claims, evidence, reasoning (not just narrative)

**THE SECRET: Discourse markers above all else**

Students who master discourse markers (>70% of exam success criteria) succeed. Students who focus on "advanced grammar" (inversion, ellipsis) but miss discourse markers struggle.

## 2. Test Reality Summary — What Eiken Analysis Shows

### The Official Description vs. Test Reality Gap

| Official Description | Test Reality | Impact on Teaching |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Bridge to university" | **Discourse markers are THE critical skill** | Teach discourse patterns, not just "more advanced grammar" |
| "Academic situations" | Academic register + logical coherence > complex grammar | Focus on formal tone and explicit connections |
| "Complex ideas" | Discourse markers create coherence, not long sentences | Use short sentences connected with clear markers |

### Four Pillars of Pre-1 Success

#### 1. Discourse Markers (CRITICAL — THE #1 Tested Feature, MISSING from official description)

**What the data shows:**
- Pre-1 introduces discourse markers as a **core tested feature**
- Unlike lower levels where simple connectors suffice, Pre-1 requires explicit logical markers
- Primary markers: *moreover, however, nevertheless, consequently, therefore, thus*

**Four marker categories (tested explicitly):**
- **Addition:** moreover, furthermore, in addition, additionally
- **Contrast:** however, nevertheless, on the other hand, conversely
- **Consequence:** therefore, consequently, as a result, thus
- **Conclusion:** in conclusion, to summarise, in summary
- **Tier 1 Priority:** Discourse markers are THE most important feature

**Test evidence:**
- 2級: Simple connectors (and, but, so) sufficient
- 準1級: Discourse markers tested explicitly in reading comprehension and writing
- Students without discourse markers = automatic failure on writing section

#### 2. Academic Register (Formal Tone Required)

**Elements of academic register:**
- Objective language (avoiding *I think*, *In my opinion* — use *Research suggests*, *Evidence indicates*)
- Nominalisation verbs → nouns (*decide* → *decision*, *argue* → *argument*)
- Latinate vocabulary over phrasal verbs (*examine* vs. *look at*)
- Passive voice for objectivity (*It is argued that...*)

**Academic vs. Non-Academic:**
- Non-academic: "I think this problem is bad."
- Academic: "This issue presents significant challenges."

**Why it matters:** Pre-1 reading passages are academic papers, research abstracts, or policy documents. Students must match this tone.

#### 3. Inversion and Ellipsis (Secondary Features)

**Inversion (stylistic emphasis):**
- *Never have I seen such...*
- *Seldom do researchers consider...*
- *Not only is X true, but Y...*

**Usage:** Low frequency compared to discourse markers. Do NOT overemphasise.

**Ellipsis (omission of understood elements):**
- *The study examined X, Y, and Z.* (Z understood to follow same pattern)
- *Some participants agreed; others refused.* (second "to participate" omitted)

**Teaching priority:** Include when it appears in exam texts, but focus learning time on discourse markers.

#### 4. Complex Linking (Beyond Basic Conjunctions)

**Advanced linking phrases:**
- *Despite the fact that...* (more formal than *Although...*)
- *In light of...* (formal cause)
- *With regard to...*formal topic introduction)
- *In terms of...* (formal category specification)

These are **supplementary** to discourse markers, not replacements.

### The "Advanced Grammar" Trap

**Current curriculum gap:**
- Many Pre-1 resources overemphasise inversion (*Seldom do I see...*) and ellipsis
- These features occur infrequently in actual exams
- Students spend disproportionate time on low-yield grammar

**Evidence from analysis:**
- Discourse markers: ESSENTIAL, tested throughout reading and writing sections
- Inversion: Occasional rhetorical device, not core skill
- Ellipsis: Stylistic option, not requirement

**Teaching priority should reflect:**
1. Discourse markers (#1 priority — minimum 6-8 per story)
2. Academic register (#2 priority)
3. Complex linking (#3 priority)
4. Inversion (<5% of teaching time)
5. Ellipsis (<5% of teaching time)

## 6. Seasonal & Cultural Context

### Overview

This section provides seasonal and cultural context for the Pre-1 curriculum. Seasonal references are **OPTIONAL**, not mandatory.

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Good, readable content** — Most important
2. **Engaging, relatable material** — Humour is ideal when appropriate
3. **Seasonal alignment** — Optional; if included, must align to correct month

**For Pre-1**: Stories can be about ANY academic/university-level topic (education, research, policy, science, economics, technology, health, international relations, etc.). Seasonal events are nice extras when they fit naturally, but should never be forced.

**Content Quality Principles:**
- Better to have excellent non-seasonal content than weak seasonal references
- Humour and engagement are more valuable than seasonal accuracy
- Students learn better when content is interesting and relatable
- Seasonal events create memorable context when used naturally, but not required

### Seasonal Alignment Policy (SIMPLIFIED)

**Seasonal Content: OPTIONAL, Not Required**

Stories may include seasonal references, but this is not mandatory:
- **Primary Priority:** Good, readable, engaging content
- **Secondary Priority:** Humour and wit make content memorable
- **Tertiary Priority:** Seasonal alignment (if relevant to topic)

**When Using Seasonal References:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Examples of Acceptable Seasonal References:**
- December story about year-end academic reviews → mentions annual university budgeting cycles
- April story about university admissions → mentions spring semester begins
- June story about environmental research → mentions rainy season data collection
- October story about public health → mentions flu season preparation

**Examples of Unforced (Non-Seasonal) Stories:**
- AI ethics and technology regulation (any month)
- International trade policy analysis (any month)
- Gender equality in academic publishing (any month)
- Healthcare systems comparison (any month)

**Humour Integration (IDEAL):**
Where appropriate, include subtle wit or humour:
- Gentle irony about academic bureaucracy delays
- Playful commentary on university deadlines and procrastination
- Relatable situations that university students recognize
- Avoid sarcasm or cynicism — keep it warm and relevant

## 7. Writing Guidelines — Sentence Length, Vocabulary, Complexity

### Sentence Length Requirements (TV-Readable)

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Average sentence length** | 10-15 words per sentence | **TV-readable with translations** |
| **Minimum sentence length** | 8 words | Avoid fragmentation |
| **Maximum sentence length** | 20 words | Strict limit for readability |
| **Sentence length variety** | 8-15 word range | Keep natural flow |
| **Percentage of sentences** (15+ words) | 20-30% | Occasional longer sentences only |

**Critical Constraint:** All sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously. This constraint applies to **all Eiken levels** (5級 through 1级).

**Note:** These targets are for individual sentences (lines 1-10), not total story word count. Each story contains exactly 20 lines.

### Sentence Length Strategy (Maintaining Grammar Complexity)

**How to maintain Pre-1 complexity without long sentences:**

1. **Use discourse markers with short sentences** instead of long embedding
   - *Long:* "Moreover, studies have demonstrated that climate change is accelerating due to greenhouse gas emissions." (15 words)
   - *Short:* "Moreover, climate change is accelerating. Greenhouse gas emissions drive this trend." (12 words total, 2 sentences)

2. **Separate clauses into distinct sentences**
   - *Long:* "However, whilst universities have proposed reforms, critics argue that insufficient consultation has occurred." (14 words)
   - *Short:* "Universities have proposed reforms. However, critics argue consultation was insufficient." (11 words total, 2 sentences)

3. **Use discourse markers to connect short sentences**
   - "The research design was robust. Therefore, the findings are reliable." (11 words total, 2 sentences)

4. **Express complex ideas in 2-3 short sentences**
   - Long: "Academic register requires formal language which avoids personal pronouns and maintains objectivity through passive constructions." (18 words)
   - Short: "Academic register requires formal language. It avoids personal pronouns. Passive constructions maintain objectivity." (14 words total, 3 sentences)

### Sentence Length Consistency Across Months

| Months | Target Length | Strategy |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| 1-3 | 10-12 words | Simple sentences, discourse markers introduced |
| 4-6 | 11-13 words | Two-sentence combinations for discourse flow |
| 7-9 | 12-14 words | Discourse markers connecting 2-3 sentences |
| 10-12 | 13-15 words | Maximum complexity within TV readable limit |

### Vocabulary Level Requirements

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Total vocabulary scope** | 3,613 words | From Pre-1 analysis |
| **Average per story** | 75-100 unique words | New + recycled vocabulary |
| **Academic word family inclusion** | 40-50 AWL words/story | AWL = Academic Word List |
| **Technical/domain vocabulary** | 12-15 terms/story | Discipline-specific (academia, research, etc.) |
| **Discourse marker density** | **6-8 markers/story** (MINIMUM) | **THE critical feature for Pre-1** |

### Vocabulary Categories by Month

| Months | Domain Focus | Example Domains |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1-3 | General academia | University systems, research basics |
| 4-6 | Social sciences | Psychology, sociology, economics |
| 7-9 | Natural sciences and technology | Science, medicine, technology, AI |
| 10-12 | Professional/Policy | Policy, governance, international relations |

### Tone and Engagement (IDEAL Quality Factors)

**Primary Tone:** Academic and formal, but engaging and accessible

**Humour (Ideal to Include Where Appropriate):**
- Use gentle wit that university students will recognise
- Irony about real academic situations (bureaucracy, deadlines, group projects)
- Playful commentary students relate to (library adventures, cafeteria food, exam anxiety)
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, mocking, or mean-spirited content

**Engagement Characteristics:**
- Relatable situations students experience
- Memorable examples that stick
- Balanced tone: professional but not dry, engaging but not silly
- Humour should be light, warm, and inclusive

**Example Humor Themes:**
- Academic bureaucracy delays and absurdities
- Perfect research plans that inevitably change
- Student procrastination and deadline madness
- Group project dynamics (everyone loves group projects)
- Conference presentation anxiety
- Reviewer feedback being politely brutal

**When to Use Humour:**
- Opening lines can grab attention
- Examples can be playful
- Conclusions can warm the tone
- **When to avoid:** Serious topics like inequality, discrimination, public health crises

### Complexity Requirements (Adapted for TV-Readable Sentences)

#### Clause Structure

| Requirement | Target | Example (TV-readable) |
|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Complex sentences** (subordinate clauses) | 30-40% of all sentences | Single independent + 1 dependent |
| **Compound sentences** | 30-40% of all sentences | Multiple independent clauses |
| **Simple sentences** | 20-30% of all sentences | Single independent clause |
| **Subordinate clause types** | At least 2 types per story | Relative, adverbial clauses |
| **Embedding depth** | 1-2 levels maximum (all months) | *[Research shows [X is true]]* |

**Key Strategy:** Use 2-3 short sentences with discourse markers instead of 1 long complex sentence with deep embedding.

**Example Transformation:**
- *Before (long):* "The research was conducted over two years, and the data was analysed using advanced statistical methods to determine whether significant correlations existed." (22 words)
- *After (TV-readable):* "The research ran for two years. Researchers analysed the data. They used advanced statistical methods." (13 words total, 3 sentences)

#### Discourse Marker Distribution (EXACT COUNTS — CRITICAL)

| Requirement | Target per Story |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Total discourse markers** | **6-8 instances (STRICT MINIMUM)** |
| **Addition markers** | 1-2 instances (*moreover, furthermore*) |
| **Contrast markers** | 1-2 instances (*however, nevertheless*) |
| **Consequence markers** | 1-2 instances (*therefore, consequently*) |
| **Conclusion markers** | 0-1 instances (*in conclusion*) - optional for mixed weeks |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Discourse markers are THE key tested feature for Pre-1. Minimum 6-8 per story — higher than other levels.

**Monthly Discourse Marker Types:**

| Month | Weeks | Discourse Type | EXACT Markers to Use | Markers to Avoid in Focus Weeks |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **January-February** | 1-8 | **Addition Focus** | moreover, furthermore, in addition, additionally | however, nevertheless, therefore, consequently |
| **March-April** | 9-16 | **Contrast Focus** | however, nevertheless, on the other hand, conversely | moreover, furthermore, therefure, consequently |
| **May-June** | 17-24 | **Consequence Focus** | therefore, consequently, as a result, thus | moreover, however, on the other hand |
| **July-August** | 25-32 | **Conclusion + Mixed** | in conclusion, to summarise, in summary, PLUS all above | — |
| **September-December** | 33-48 | **ALL TYPES** (mixed) | All 12 markers rotated | — |

## 9. Story Structure — Format Requirements

### Content Format Requirements

Each story contains 20 lines total:
- **Lines 1-10:** 10 STORY sentences (academic/professional content) with emoji + English + Japanese
- **Lines 11-20:** 10 DISCUSSION questions (personal opinion prompts) with emoji + English + Japanese

**⚠️ CRITICAL JAPANESE TRANSLATION RULE:**

**ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS**

Lines 1-10 (Story sentences): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)
Lines 11-20 (Questions): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)

**EVERY LINE format:**
```
[Emoji] [English: 10-15 words]
[Japanese translation]
```

**❌ WRONG (missing Japanese on questions):**
```
🎓 Should university education be free for all students?
Q? Does online learning work better than classroom learning?
```

**✅ CORRECT (Japanese on ALL lines):**
```
🎓 Should university education be free for all students?
大学教育を全学生に無料にすべきですか？

💻 Does online learning work better than classroom learning in your opinion?
あなたの意見では、オンライン学習は教室での学習よりもうまく機能しますか？
```

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

**Story Sentences (Lines 1-10):**
- Academic/professional content about a specific theme (e.g., online learning, AI ethics, climate research)
- Each sentence is 10-15 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Sentences form a cohesive narrative about an academic topic
- Grammar features: discourse markers (6-8 required), academic register, complex linking

**Discussion Questions (Lines 11-20):**
- **STAND-ALONE personal discussion questions** anyone can answer from their own knowledge/opinion
- Each question is 10-15 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Questions use **similar grammar/vocabulary** to the story but are about the **THEME**, not the story content
- Questions do NOT require reading the story
- Questions are conversation/discussion prompts for students to give personal opinions

**Example from Pre-1 structure (Online Learning story):**

**Story Sentences (about university online learning):**
```
🎓 Moreover, universities are expanding online learning programmes.
大学はオンライン学習プログラムを拡大しています。

💻 Furthermore, digital platforms offer flexible study schedules.
さらに、デジタルプラットフォームは柔軟な学習スケジュールを提供します。

😊 However, some students prefer traditional classroom interactions.

💻 Does online learning work better than classroom learning?
オンライン学習は教室での学習よりもうまく機能しますか？

😊 How does technology affect your study habits daily?
技術はあなたの毎日の学習習慣にどのように影響しますか？

[... 7 more questions about education, learning, technology ...]
```

**Pattern:** Same format for ALL 20 lines:
```
😊 English sentence OR question (10-15 words).
日本語の翻訳です。
```

**Key Points:**
- Both story sentences AND discussion questions follow the SAME format
- NO empty lines in the story content
- Each story is exactly 20 lines (10 story sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **ALL lines must be 10-15 words** (TV readable constraint)
- Questions are **personal opinion prompts**, NOT reading comprehension tests
- **STORY MUST HAVE 6-8 DISCOURSE MARKERS** (Lines 1-10)

### Quality Control Checklist

Before finalizing any story, verify:

#### Grammar Verification

- [ ] Discourse markers correct and sufficient (6-8 instances)
- [ ] Discourse markers appropriate to logical flow
- [ ] Academic register maintained throughout
- [ ] Complex linking phrases used appropriately
- [ ] Nominalisation where required
- [ ] Academic passive where feature focus
- [ ] Clause variety (relative, adverbial clauses)

#### Vocabulary Verification

- [ ] Vocabulary matches Pre-1 level (3,613-word scope)
- [ ] AWL words present and correctly used
- [ ] Domain terminology accurate to theme
- [ ] Formal/Latinate vocabulary for academic tone
- [ ] No Pre-1 vocabulary gap (too basic)
- [ ] No Pre-1 vocabulary overload (too advanced)

#### Coherence Verification

- [ ] Discourse markers create clear logical flow
- [ ] Argument structure logical (connected by markers)
- [ ] Thematic consistency maintained
- [ ] Referential links clear (pronouns, nominal reference)
- [ ] Academic tone appropriate (formal, objective)

#### Length Verification

- [ ] Average sentence length 10-15 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- [ ] No sentence exceeds 20 words maximum
- [ ] Story contains exactly 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 questions)
- [ ] Word count 75-100 unique vocabulary

#### Discourse Marker Verification (CRITICAL FOR PRE-1)

- [ ] Count discourse markers: 6-8 instances

- [ ] Markers are correctly positioned (start of sentences or clauses)
- [ ] Logical flow is enhanced by markers
- [ ] Marker variety appropriate (not repetitive)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Insufficient discourse markers** → Minimum 6 required; stories with 2-3 will fail
2. **Missing discourse markers in focus weeks** → If week focus is "Addition", use addition markers
3. **Everyday conversation topics** → Pre-1 requires academic/professional themes
4. **Long sentences** → TV readability constraint: **MAX 15 words average, 20 words maximum**
5. **Informal tone** → Academic register required; no "I think", no slang
6. **Mixed discourse types in focus weeks** → Week 2 = Addition focus, don't use "however"
7. **Missing discourse markers entirely** → Stories without markers = automatic failure
8. **Personal pronouns in story sentences** → Use objective language (*It has been shown...*, not *I believe...*)
