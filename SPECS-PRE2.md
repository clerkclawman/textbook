## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Grammar
- ❌ Past perfect confusion with simple past — ensure distinction is clear
- ❌ Tag question confusion — verify tag matches main verb
- ❌ Incorrect modal perfects
- ❌ Confusing dependent clauses
- ❌ Still using only simple sentences — challenge students with complex structures

### Vocabulary
- ❌ Too difficult vocabulary — keep B1 level (3,000-4,000 words)
- ❌ Slang/colloquialisms — maintain standard academic register
- ❌ Too many new words per story — introduce vocabulary gradually

### Content
- ❌ Still too simple for high school — topics should respect 16-17 year old intelligence
- ❌ Too abstract — keep most topics concrete
- ❌ Boring topics — choose engaging, relevant topics
