# Eiken Grade 2 Level Specification
## Aligned to Test Reality — Not Official Descriptions

**Created:** 23 February 2026  
**Based on:** Analysis of 2025 Eiken exams (第1-3回), 78 PDFs  
**Data sources:** [eiken-synthesis.md](../eiken-resources/eiken-synthesis.md), [QUICK-REFERENCE.md](../eiken-resources/QUICK-REFERENCE.md), [analysis-results.json](../eiken-resources/eiken-analysis-deepseek/analysis-results.json)  
**Target:** 48 stories over 12-month curriculum (4 stories/month × 12 months)

---

## 1. Level Overview — Grade 2 Summary

### Profile
- **Official Description:** Social and professional situations for effective communication
- **Test Reality:** Academic topics with emphasis on mixed conditionals, advanced reported speech, and noun clauses
- **Vocabulary Scope:** 2,447 unique words (+16% jump from 準2級プラス's 2,111 words)
- **Sentence Length:** 10-15 words average (TV-readable with translations)
- **Proficiency Level:** University pre-intermediate to intermediate — academic English foundations
- **Critical Constraint:** Sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously

### Critical Transition: 準2級プラス → 2級

This is a **significant transition point** in the Eiken progression:

| Metric | 準2級プラス | 2級 | Change | Significance |
|--------|----------|-----|--------|--------------|
| Vocabulary | 2,111 | 2,447 | +16% | Moderate but meaningful expansion |
| Sentence length | 10-15 words | 10-15 words | 0% | **TV-readable constraint applies to all levels** |
| **Mixed conditionals** | Previewed (1st/2nd) | **Core skill** | NEW | Combining past/present contexts |
| **Advanced reported speech** | Basic (present/past) | **Complex patterns** | Major | Backshifting, time/place expressions |
| **Noun clauses** | Minimal | **Core skill** | NEW | What/that/if/whether clauses |
| Academic passive | High | **Continued emphasis** | — | Objectivity remains important |
| Modals | High usage | **Continued emphasis** | — | Probability/possibility focus |

**Note on Sentence Length:** Whilst actual Grade 2 exams use 18-22 word average sentences, this curriculum uses 10-15 words to ensure TV readability with translations. Grammar complexity is maintained through strategic use of mixed conditionals, advanced reported speech, and noun clauses, rather than long embedding.

### What Makes Grade 2 Different

**Unlike previous levels:**
1. **Mixed conditionals** — Combining past conditions with present results (and vice versa)
2. **Multi-level reported speech** — Complex backshifting across multiple speakers
3. **Noun clauses as subjects/objects** — Abstract thinking through embedded statements
4. **Academic topics** — Environment, science, politics, not just everyday situations
5. **Abstract reasoning** — Hypothetical scenarios and theoretical discussions

## 2. Test Reality Summary — What Eiken Analysis Shows

### The Official Description vs. Test Reality Gap

| Official Description | Test Reality | Impact on Teaching |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Social and professional situations" | **Academic topics dominate** (environment, science, politics) | Don't limit to workplace dialogue |
| "Effective communication" | **Conditionals + reported speech are core** | Teach hypothetical and reported speech patterns |
| "Wide range of vocabulary" | **2,447 words (+16% from P2Plus)** | Expand vocabulary systematically |
| "Express opinions appropriately" | **Noun clauses for abstract expression** | Teach embedded statements for nuance |

### Three Pillars of Grade 2 Success

#### 1. Mixed Conditionals (CRITICAL — New at Grade 2)

**What the data shows:**
- 準2級プラス introduces 2nd conditionals (*If I were*), but keeps them separate
- Grade 2 COMBINES conditionals: past condition + present result, present condition + past result
- This is tested in reading passages and listening contexts requiring complex temporal reasoning

**Test evidence:**
- 準2級: 1st conditionals (*If...will*), 2nd conditionals (*If I were...*) separately
- 準2級プラス: 2nd conditionals established, but not mixed
- 2級: **Mixed conditionals appear** (*If I had studied, I would be happy now*)

**Core patterns:**
1. **Past condition, present result:** *If I had studied harder, I would be at university now.*
2. **Present condition, past result:** *If I were more organised, I would have finished on time.*
3. **Past condition, past result (3rd conditional):** *If I had known, I would have told you.*

#### 2. Advanced Reported Speech (Core Extension from P2Plus)

**Continuing features from P2Plus:**
- Basic backshifting (present → past, past → past perfect)
- Time and place expressions (now → then, here → there, tomorrow → the next day)
- Pronoun changes (I → he/she, we → they, my → his/her)

**Grade 2 additions:**
- **Multi-level reported speech:** *She said that he told her that he would arrive.*
- **Reported questions:** *He asked me if I was coming.*
- **Reported commands/requests:** *She told him to wait.*
- **Mixed tenses in complex reporting:** *He mentioned that he had been planning the trip for months.*

**Academic applications:**
- Research summaries (*The study concluded that...)
- Literature reviews (*Researchers have found that...)
- Policy statements (*The government announced that...)

#### 3. Noun Clauses (CRITICAL — New at Grade 2)

**What the data shows:**
- Noun clauses tested as subjects, objects, and complements
- Essential for expressing abstract thoughts and hypothetical scenarios
- Common in academic writing and professional reports

**Test evidence:**
- 準2級プラス: Minimal noun clause usage
- 2級: **Noun clauses appear regularly** in reading passages and comprehension questions

**Core patterns:**
1. **Question words:** *What he said was surprising.* (subject)
2. **That-clauses:** *I believe that climate change is serious.* (object)
3. **If/whether:** *I don't know if it will rain.* (object)
4. **Wh-clauses as object:** *She explained why she left early.*

**Academic applications:**
- Problem statements (*What concerns researchers is...)
- Thesis statements (*This paper argues that...)
- Hypotheses (*Whether this approach works is uncertain.*

### The Academic Scope Expansion

**Current curriculum gap:**
- Many Grade 2 resources focus on everyday situations (shopping, travel, work)
- Actual exams include significant academic content (environment, science, politics)
- Students lack vocabulary for abstract academic topics

**Evidence from analysis:**
- Grade 2 vocabulary (2,447 words) includes academic terminology from these domains
- Reading passages discuss environmental issues, scientific research, policy debates
- Teaching priority should reflect: Academic topics > Everyday situations

**Domains to emphasise:**
1. **Environment:** Climate change, sustainability, pollution, conservation
2. **Science:** Technology, research methods, scientific discoveries
3. **Politics:** Government policies, elections, international relations
4. **Society:** Education, healthcare, economics, social issues

## 6. Seasonal & Cultural Context

### Overview

This section provides seasonal and cultural context for the Grade 2 curriculum. Seasonal references are **OPTIONAL**, not mandatory.

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Good, readable content** — Most important
2. **Engaging, relatable material** — Humour is ideal when appropriate
3. **Seasonal alignment** — Optional; if included, must align to correct month

**For Grade 2:** Stories should focus on academic topics (education, environment, science, politics, technology). Seasonal events are nice extras when they fit naturally, but should never be forced.

**Content Quality Principles:**
- Better to have excellent non-seasonal content than weak seasonal references
- Humour and engagement are more valuable than seasonal accuracy
- Students learn better when content is interesting and relatable
- Seasonal events create memorable context when used naturally, but not required

### Seasonal Alignment Policy (SIMPLIFIED)

**Seasonal Content: OPTIONAL, Not Required**

Stories may include seasonal references, but this is not mandatory:
- **Primary Priority:** Good, readable, engaging content
- **Secondary Priority:** Humour and wit make content memorable
- **Tertiary Priority:** Seasonal alignment (if relevant to topic)

**When Using Seasonal References:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Tone and Engagement (IDEAL Quality Factors):**

**Primary Tone:** Academic but accessible, engaging and relevant

**Humour (Ideal to Include Where Appropriate):**
- Use gentle wit that students will recognise
- Irony about academic situations (study stress, deadlines, group projects)
- Playful commentary students relate to (exam preparation, library adventures)
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, mocking, or mean-spirited content

**Engagement Characteristics:**
- Relatable situations students experience
- Memorable examples that stick
- Balanced tone: academic but not dry, engaging but not silly
- Humour should be light, warm, and inclusive

**Example Humor Themes:**
- Exam preparation struggles and last-minute cramming
- Group project dynamics (everyone LOVES group work)
- Library adventures and book hunt challenges
- Lost homework or forgotten assignment panics
- Classroom technology failures (projector crisis!)
- Confusing academic jargon decoded

**When to Use Humour:**
- Opening lines can grab attention
- Examples can be playful
- Conclusions can warm the tone
- **When to avoid:** Serious topics like environmental disasters, political conflicts

### 2026 Calendar Reference

| Month 11 | Weeks 41-44 | Oct 5 - Nov 1 |
| Month 12 | Weeks 45-48 | Nov 2 - Nov 29 |

### Seasonal Vocabulary Integration

**Domain-specific seasonal terms for Grade 2:**

| Seasonal Category | Academic Vocabulary | Example Context |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Education calendar** | semester, term, enrolment, examination, graduation | Academic planning |
| **Environmental seasons** | seasonal variation, weather pattern, climate cycle, temperature fluctuation | Climate change research |
| **Academic seasons** | conference season, publication cycle, submission deadline, review period | Research timing |

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce seasonal vocabulary within academic contexts, not as isolated lists. Students should encounter terms in research discussions, policy documents, and academic summaries where seasonal factors are relevant.

## 7. Writing Guidelines — Sentence Length, Vocabulary, Complexity

### Sentence Length Requirements (TV-Readable)

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Average sentence length** | 10-15 words per sentence | **TV-readable with translations** |
| **Minimum sentence length** | 8 words | Avoid fragmentation |
| **Maximum sentence length** | 20 words | Strict limit for readability |
| **Sentence length variety** | 8-15 word range | Keep natural flow |
| **Percentage of sentences** (15+ words) | 20-30% | Occasional longer sentences only |

**Critical Constraint:** All sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously. This constraint applies to **all Eiken levels** (5級 through 2級).

**Note:** These targets are for individual sentences (lines 1-10), not total story word count. Each story contains exactly 20 lines. whilst actual Grade 2 exams use 18-22 word average sentences, this curriculum uses 10-15 words for TV readability.

### Sentence Length Strategy (Maintaining Grammar Complexity)

**How to maintain Grade 2 complexity without long sentences:**

1. **Use short sentences with conditionals** instead of long embedding
   - *Instead of:* "If the researchers had conducted the study more carefully, they would have discovered the error earlier, which would have saved time." (25 words)
   - *Use:* "If researchers had been more careful, they would have found the error. This would have saved time." (16 words across 2 sentences)

2. **Separate reported speech clauses**
   - *Instead of:* "She told me that she believed the government would announce the new policy next month, which surprised everyone." (21 words)
   - *Use:* "She told me she believed the government would announce the policy. This surprised everyone." (15 words across 2 sentences)

3. **Use discourse connectors for noun clauses**
   - "What concerns researchers is clear. Climate change is accelerating. Action is necessary." (12 words across 3 sentences)

### Sentence Length Consistency Across Months

| Months | Target Length | Strategy |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| 1-3 | 10-12 words | Simple sentences, conditionals introduced |
| 4-6 | 11-13 words | Two-sentence combinations |
| 7-9 | 12-14 words | Discourse connectors, 2-3 sentences |
| 10-12 | 13-15 words | Maximum complexity within TV readable limit |

### Vocabulary Level Requirements

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Total vocabulary scope** | 2,447 words | From Grade 2 analysis |
| **Average per story** | 60-80 unique words | New + recycled vocabulary |
| **Academic vocabulary** | 40-50 words/story | Environment, science, politics |
| **Domain-specific vocabulary** | 10-15 terms/story | Education, research, policy |
| **Grammar-feature vocabulary** | 15-20 words/story | Conditional markers, reporting verbs |

### Vocabulary Categories by Month

| Months | Domain Focus | Example Domains |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1-3 | General academic | Education, study methods, goals |
| 4-6 | Environment and Technology | Climate, sustainability, innovation |
| 7-9 | Research and Policy | Academic writing, publication, politics |
| 10-12 | Advanced Topics | Complex environmental issues, scientific advances |

### Complexity Requirements (Adapted for TV-Readable Sentences)

#### Conditional Structure

| Requirement | Target per Story | Example (TV-readable) |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Mixed conditionals** | 3-5 instances | Past condition + present result |
| **3rd conditionals** | 2-3 instances | Past condition + past result |
| **Conditional variety** | At least 2 types | Mixed + 3rd or modals |

**Key Strategy:** Use 2 short sentences for complex conditionals instead of 1 long sentence.

**Example Transformation:**
- *Before (long):* "If the government had invested more in renewable energy earlier, we would not be facing such severe climate consequences today." (23 words)
- *After (TV-readable):* "If the government had invested earlier, consequences would be less severe. We face climate challenges now." (16 words total, 2 sentences)

#### Reported Speech Structure

| Requirement | Target per Story |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Multi-level reported speech** | 2-3 instances | *She said that he told her...* |
| **Reported questions** | 2-3 instances | *He asked if I was...* |
| **Reported commands** | 1-2 instances | *She told him to wait.* |
| **Academic reporting** | 2-3 instances | *The study concluded that...* |

#### Noun Clause Structure

| Requirement | Target per Story |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Question-word clauses** | 2-3 instances | *What matters is...* |
| **That-clauses as objects** | 2-3 instances | *I believe that...* |
| **If/whether clauses** | 2-3 instances | *I don't know if...* |
| **Wh-clauses as objects** | 1-2 instances | *She explained why...* |

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL: ACADEMIC PASSIVE IS MANDATORY — EVERY STORY MUST HAVE 5-8 PASSIVE SENTENCES ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST COMMON FAILURE MODE**

Despite explicit requirements, agents repeatedly generate stories with ONLY 0-3 passive sentences (need 5-8 MANDATORY).

**Passive Voice Structure:**

**CORRECT Academic Passive:**
- "The study **was conducted** over three years."
- "Research **has been published** in the journal."
- "Data **were analysed** using statistical methods."
- "The theory **is supported** by multiple studies."

**INCORRECT — Active Voice (Agents incorrectly use this):**
- ❌ "Researchers **conducted** the study." (active voice)
- ❌ "The journal **published** the research." (active voice)

---

### EXACT REQUIREMENT: Specific Lines MUST Be Passive

**MANDATORY: Lines 1-5 Are FORCED PASSIVE — No Active Voice Allowed**

**Story Structure (FORCED PASSIVE REQUIREMENT):**

```
Line 1:  MUST BE PASSIVE ("was/were [verb]ed" or "is/are [verb]ed")
Line 2:  MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 3:  MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 4:  MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 5:  MUST BE PASSIVE

Lines 6-10: Can be ACTIVE or PASSIVE (no restriction)
Lines 11-20: Questions — Can be ACTIVE or PASSIVE (no restriction)
```

**Example Story with 5 Forced Passive Sentences (CORRECT):**

```
Line 1: The study was conducted at the university. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
Line 2: Data were collected from multiple sources. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
Line 3: Results have been published in journals. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
Line 4: The theory is supported by evidence. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
Line 5: New methods are being developed. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
Line 6: However, researchers continue their work. (ACTIVE ✓ OK)
Line 7: Moreover, funding has been secured. (PASSIVE ✓ OK)
```

---

### MANDATORY Checklist for Every Story

**Before finalizing a story, verify:**

- [ ] Count passive sentences in Lines 1-10 (story sentences)
- [ ] If count < 5: ADD MORE PASSIVE SENTENCES
- [ ] If count > 8: REMOVE SOME PASSIVE SENTENCES
- [ ] Questions (Lines 11-20): Can be active voice (no requirement)

**Passive Sentence Construction:**
- Look for: "is/are/was/were + [verb]ed" or "has/have been + [verb]ed" or "is/are being + [verb]ed"
- Each passive sentence counts toward the 5-8 requirement
- You MUST have EXACTLY 5-8 passive sentences in Lines 1-10

---

### Cohesion and Coherence

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| **Paragraph transitions** | Discourse connectors between ideas |
| **Thematic consistency** | One academic topic per story |
| **Logical flow** | Argument structure (claim → support → conclusion) |
| **Referential clarity** | Pronouns with clear antecedents |

---
**Reference:** See [analysis-results.json](../eiken-resources/eiken-analysis-deepseek/analysis-results.json) for word frequency data supporting these vocabulary targets.

## 9. Story Structure — Format Requirements

### Content Format Requirements

Each story contains 20 lines total:
- **Lines 1-10:** 10 STORY sentences (academic content) with emoji + English + Japanese
- **Lines 11-20:** 10 DISCUSSION questions (personal opinion prompts) with emoji + English + Japanese

**⚠️ CRITICAL JAPANESE TRANSLATION RULE:**

**ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS**

Lines 1-10 (Story sentences): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)
Lines 11-20 (Questions): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)

**EVERY LINE format:**
```
[Emoji] [English: 10-15 words]
[Japanese translation]
```

**❌ WRONG (missing Japanese on questions):**
```
📚 Should environmental action be prioritised?
Q? Does technology help or harm society?
```

**✅ CORRECT (Japanese on ALL lines):**
```
📚 Should environmental action be prioritised by governments?
政府は環境を優先すべきですか？

🔬 Does technology help or harm society today?
技術は今日社会を助けますか、それとも害しますか？
```

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

**Story Sentences (Lines 1-10):**
- Academic content about a specific theme (e.g., climate change, research methods, education policy)
- Each sentence is 10-15 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Sentences form a cohesive narrative about an academic topic
- Grammar features: mixed conditionals, reported speech, noun clauses

**Discussion Questions (Lines 11-20):**
- **STAND-ALONE personal discussion questions** anyone can answer from their own knowledge/opinion
- Each question is 10-15 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Questions use **similar grammar/vocabulary** to the story but are about the **THEME**, not the story content
- Questions do NOT require reading the story
- Questions are conversation/discussion prompts for students to give personal opinions

**Pattern:** Same format for ALL 20 lines:
```
😊 English sentence OR question (10-15 words).
日本語の翻訳です。
```

- **Pattern:** Past condition + present result (*If I had studied...*) OR Present condition + past result (*If I were...*)
- **Include at least 3 different conditional patterns**
- **Mix with modals where appropriate** (*If I could have gone, I might have...*)
- **Use for hypothetical scenarios** and counterfactual reasoning

#### Reported Speech Focus Weeks

- **Include multi-level reporting** (*She said that he told her...*) — 2-3 instances
- **Include reported questions** (*He asked if I was...*) — 2-3 instances
- **Include reported commands** (*She told him to wait.*) — 1-2 instances
- **Include academic reporting** (*The study concluded that...*) — 2-3 instances
- **Verify backshifting** (am→was, have→had, will→would) consistently

#### Noun Clauses Focus Weeks

- **Include question-word clauses** (*What matters is...*) — 2-3 instances
- **Include that-clauses as objects** (*I believe that...*) — 2-3 instances
- **Include if/whether clauses** (*I don't know if...*) — 2-3 instances
- **Include wh-clauses as objects** (*She explained why...*) — 1-2 instances

#### Academic Passive Focus Weeks

- **Spread across different tenses** (present, past, perfect)
- **Use for academic conventions** (*It is argued that...*, *Results were found...*)
- **Ensure agent removal for objectivity**

### Quality Control Checklist

Before finalizing any story, verify:

#### Grammar Verification

- [ ] Mixed conditionals correctly used (if story is conditional focus)
- [ ] Reported speech backshifting correct (if story is reported speech focus)
- [ ] Noun clauses properly structured (if story is noun clause focus)
- [ ] Academic passive includes agent omission (true passive)
- [ ] **5-8 PASSIVE SENTENCES in Lines 1-10** (MANDATORY for EVERY story)

#### Vocabulary Verification

- [ ] Vocabulary matches Grade 2 level (2,447-word scope)
- [ ] Academic vocabulary present and correctly used
- [ ] Domain terminology accurate to theme
- [ ] Grade 2 vocabulary appropriate (not too basic, not beyond level)

#### Coherence Verification

- [ ] Paragraph transitions clear
- [ ] Narrative structure logical
- [ ] Thematic consistency maintained
- [ ] Referential links clear

#### Length Verification

- [ ] Average sentence length 10-15 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- [ ] No sentence exceeds 20 words maximum
- [ ] Story contains exactly 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 questions)
- [ ] **ALL 20 lines have Japanese translations** (MANDATORY)

#### Format Verification

- [ ] Uses `var eiken2aligned = [...]` array format
- [ ] Exactly TWO properties: title and content
- [ ] Content uses template literal backticks
- [ ] NO additional properties (week, theme, etc.)
- [ ] Lines 1-5: FORCED PASSIVE (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Questions (Lines 11-20): Japanese translations present

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Underemphasis on conditionals** → Stories should have 3-5 mixed conditionals in focus weeks
2. **Incorrect backshifting** → Check that reported speech properly shifts tenses
3. **Missing noun clauses** → Stories need 2-3 noun clause instances in focus weeks
4. **Insufficient passive voice** → **0-3 passive is WRONG — need 5-8 MANDATORY**
5. **Long sentences** → TV readability constraint: **MAX 15 words average, 20 words maximum**
6. **Missing Japanese translations** → **ALL 20 lines must have Japanese** (major failure mode)
7. **Wrong JSON format** → MUST use `var eiken2aligned = [...]` with exactly 2 properties
8. **Everyday conversation topics** → Grade 2 requires academic topics, not casual chat
9. **String concatenation** → MUST use template literal backticks, not +
