# Eiken Grade 5 — 48-Story Master Plan

**Created:** 23 February 2026  
**Based on:** SPEC-EIKEN5-ALIGNED.md (Grade 5 Blueprint)  
**Total Stories:** 48 (4 stories/month × 12 months)  
**Curriculum Duration:** 12 months (48 weeks)

---

## 1. Overview

### Curriculum Summary
- **Total stories:** 48 (Weeks 1-48)
- **Format per story:** 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **Sentence length:** 10-12 words average (TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously)
- **ALL lines (1-20):** Emoji + English (10-12 words) + Japanese translation

**⚠️ CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE: NO PROGRESSION**

**All 48 stories are at the SAME Grade 5 difficulty level.** No progressive building to "mastery."

**Why No Progression:**
- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Monthly Changes = Variety Only (NOT Progression):**
- Alternating pattern: Mixed weeks → Focus weeks → Mixed weeks → Focus weeks
- Focus rotation: Present Continuous → Wh-Questions → Be-Verb Questions (repeat cycle)
- Different topics for variety (family, school, hobbies, weather, seasons, etc.)
- NO "mastery phase" or "advanced phase"

**Every Single Story (Weeks 1-48) Must Have:**
- **Mixed weeks (24 stories):** Present Continuous (4-6) + Wh-questions (4-6) + Be-verb questions (3-5) instances
- **Present Continuous focus weeks (8 stories):** 8-10 PC instances
- **Wh-Question focus weeks (8 stories):** 7-9 Wh instances  
- **Be-Verb Question focus weeks (8 stories):** 6-8 Be instances
- Sentence length: 10-12 words (max 15)
- Japanese translations: ALL 20 lines

This makes infinite content generation possible at Grade 5 level — any week can be a student's first or last.

### Story Structure
**Lines 1-10:** Story sentences (content about a theme for elementary students)  
**Lines 11-20:** Discussion questions (stand-alone personal prompts about the theme)

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE:** ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS

**Format:**
```
😊 English sentence or question (10-12 words).
日本語の翻訳
```

### Grade 5 Profile (From Test Reality)
- **Vocabulary:** 558 unique words (entry-level Eiken)
- **Present Continuous:** 36 occurrences (dominant feature — more than present simple)
- **Wh-Questions:** 25+ occurrences (40%+ of tested patterns)
- **Be-Verb Questions:** 20+ occurrences (25%+ of tested patterns)
- **Sentence Length:** 10-12 words average (TV-readable constraint)
- **Level:** Beginner elementary — daily life, immediate actions, observable situations

## 6. Content Quality Guidelines

### Primary Priority: Age-Appropriate Content
- **Above all:** Stories should be engaging and relatable for elementary students (ages 8-12)
- **Simple language:** 10-12 word sentences are easy to understand and translate
- **Positive tone:** Encouraging, friendly, relatable situations
- **Topic relevance:** Family, school, hobbies, weather, seasons, sports, food, animals

### Secondary Priority: Simple humour and Fun
**Use humour where appropriate to make content relatable:**

**Appropriate humour themes:**
- Funny situations at school
- Playful family moments
- Silly questions children ask
- Animals doing funny things
- Weather surprises (rain on picnics, etc.)

**Humour principles:**
- Gentle humour that children understand
- Situations kids recognise from their lives
- Playful, lighthearted tone
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, complex irony, adult jokes

**When to use humour:**
- Everyday situations can have funny moments
- Animals behaving strangely (but kindly)
- Small misunderstandings that are harmless
- **When to avoid:** Sad topics, serious problems

### Tertiary Priority: Seasonal References (OPTIONAL)
**Seasonal content is OPTIONAL — do not force it**

**If using seasonal references:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month:
  - Cherry blossoms: March-April (Japan)
  - Summer beaches: July-August
  - Christmas: December
  - Snow: January/December
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Better non-seasonal than weak seasonal:**
- ✅ Excellent story about family dinner
- ❌ Weak reference to Christmas in July (confusing)

### Topic Flexibility
**Stories can be about ANY age-appropriate topic:**
- Family members and activities
- School life and learning
- Hobbies and sports
- Weather and seasons
- Food and cooking  
- Animals and pets
- Daily routines (getting up, eating, playing)
- Friends and feelings

**Quality principle:** Topic flexibility allows creators to choose themes suitable for Grade 5
