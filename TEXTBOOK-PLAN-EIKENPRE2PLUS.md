# Eiken Pre-2 Plus (準2級プラス) — 48-Story Master Plan

**Created:** 23 February 2026
**Based on:** SPEC-EIKENPRE2PLUS-ALIGNED.md Version 1.1
**Total Stories:** 48 (4 stories/month × 12 months)
**Curriculum Duration:** 12 months (48 weeks)

---

## 1. Overview

### Curriculum Summary
- **Total stories:** 48 (Weeks 1-48)
- **Format per story:** 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **Sentence length:** 16-19 words average (TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously)
- **ALL lines (1-20):** Emoji + English (16-19 words) + Japanese translation

**⚠️ CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE: NO PROGRESSION**

**All 48 stories are at the SAME Pre-2 Plus difficulty level.** No progressive building to "mastery."

**Why No Progression:**
- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Monthly Changes = Variety Only (NOT Progression):**
- Fair rotation of ALL passive tenses (present, past, perfect, future)
- Fair rotation of 2nd conditionals patterns
- Fair rotation of modals and reported speech
- Different topics for variety (school, travel, hobbies, family, etc.)
- NO "integration phase" or "mastery phase"

**Every Single Story (Weeks 1-48) Must Have:**
- **PASSIVE VOICE: 8-12 sentences per story (MANDATORY — PRE-2 PLUS CORE FEATURE)**
- Passive tenses: Present, past, perfect, future distributed fairly
- 2nd conditionals: 2-4 instances (flexible, fair rotation across 48 stories)
- Modals: 3-5 instances (continuation from 準2級)
- Reported speech: 2-3 instances (Months 3-12)
- Sentence length: 16-19 words (max 22)
- Japanese translations: ALL 20 lines

This makes infinite content generation possible for a real skill — any week can be a student's first or last at Pre-2 Plus level.

### Story Structure
**Lines 1-10:** Story sentences (teenage/everyday content about a theme)
**Lines 11-20:** Discussion questions (stand-alone personal opinion prompts about the theme)

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE:** ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS

**Format:**
```
😊 English sentence or question (16-19 words).
日本語の翻訳
```

### Pre-2 Plus Profile (From Test Reality)
- **Vocabulary:** 2,111 unique words (+14% from 準2級)
- **PASSIVE EXPLOSION:** 20 occurrences (+300% from 準2級's 5) — **THE KEY FEATURE**
- **2nd conditionals:** NEW feature at this level — counterfactual reasoning
- **Modals:** Continuation from 準2級 (88 occurrences, still dominant)
- **Sentence length:** 16-19 words average (TV-readable for simultaneous translation display)
- **Proficiency level:** Upper high school to first-year university — intermediate-advanced

---

## 2. Weekly Grammar Focus Pattern (48-Week Rotation)

### Core Principle: PASSIVE DOMINANCE + FAIR ROTATION

**This is the defining feature of Pre-2 Plus:**
- 準2級: Passive voice = 5 occurrences (minimal, just introduction)
- Pre-2 Plus: Passive voice = 20 occurrences (+300% jump)
- Curriculum requirement: **8-12 passive sentences per story** (out of 10 total)

**Weekly Pattern (Rotates through 48 weeks):**
```
Week 1: MIXED (passive dominant across all tenses)
Week 2: Focus: Passive - Present Tense (8-10 instances)
Week 3: MIXED (passive dominant across all tenses)
Week 4: Focus: Passive - Past Tense (8-10 instances)
Week 5: MIXED (passive dominant across all tenses)
Week 6: Focus: Passive - Perfect Tense (8-10 instances)
Week 7: MIXED (passive dominant across all tenses)
Week 8: Focus: 2nd Conditionals (8-10 instances)
[This 8-week pattern repeats 6 times across 48 weeks]
```

### Pattern Breakdown: What Each Week Focuses On

#### MIXED Weeks (Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47 — 24 total)

- **2nd conditionals:** 0-2 instances (flexible)
- **Modals:** 3-5 instances (can/could/should/must/would/might)
- **Reported speech:** 0-2 instances ( Months 3-12)

**Strategy:** MIXED weeks provide variety and exposure to all passive tenses in a balanced way

#### Focus: 2nd Conditionals (Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 — 6 total)

**Grammar focus:** 2nd conditionals emphasised
- **2nd conditionals:** 4-6 instances (*If + past simple, ...would + base verb*)
- **Passive voice:** Still 8-12 sentences (MANDATORY — never reduced)
- **Purpose:** Hypothetical situations, counterfactual reasoning

## 4. Grammar Requirements per Story (CRITICAL)

### Passive Voice: 8-12 Sentences (MANDATORY — PRE-2 PLUS CORE FEATURE)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (FIXED FOR RECURRING FAILURE):**

Natural language training makes models prefer ACTIVE voice. Instructions like "include 8-12 passive" are repeatedly ignored at Pre-2 Plus level.

**SOLUTION: FORCE PASSIVE IN SPECIFIC LINES**

```
Line 1: MUST BE PASSIVE ("was/were [verb]ed" or "is/are [verb]ed" or "has/have been [verb]ed")
Line 2: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 3: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 4: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 5: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 6: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 7: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 8: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 9: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 10: MUST BE PASSIVE

Lines 11-20: Questions — Can be ACTIVE or PASSIVE (no restriction)
```

**Example (CORRECT — Pre-2 Plus level):**
- Line 1: Classes are held every day at school. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 2: Homework is assigned by teachers regularly. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 3: The library is used by many students. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 4: Books are borrowed for two-week periods. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 5: Exams are given at the end of terms. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 6: Tests are marked carefully by teachers. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 7: Sports are played after school ends. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 8: Activities are organised by student clubs. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 9: Lunch is served in the cafeteria daily. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 10: Rules are followed by everyone at school. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
- Line 11: Do you think homework should be given every day? (QUESTION — active ok)
- Line 12-20: [More questions about the theme]

**Result:** Lines 1-10 = 10 PASSIVE SENTENCES (FORCED), requirement EXCEEDED ✅

**This is CORRECT for Pre-2 Plus — passive must dominate.**

**Passive Patterns (use these):**
- Present passive: "is/are + [verb]ed" (*Classes are held every day.*)
- Past passive: "was/were + [verb]ed" (*The trip was organised last week.*)
- Present perfect passive: "has/have been + [verb]ed" (*Data have been analysed.*)
- Past perfect passive: "had been + [verb]ed" (*The results had been published.*)
- Future passive: "will be + [verb]ed" (*The meeting will be held tomorrow.*)

**Passive with by-agent (include 1-2 per story when appropriate):**
- "The book was written by a famous author."
- "The project was organised by the student council."
- "The meal was prepared by my grandmother."

### 2nd Conditionals: 2-4 Instances (Fair Rotation)
- **Target:** 0-6 instances depending on weekly focus
- **Focus weeks (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48):** 4-6 instances emphasised

- **Patterns:** Present → Past, will → would, can → could
- **Context:** Conversations, interviews, news reports

### All Sentences: 16-19 Words Maximum (TV-Readable Constraint)

## 6. Content Quality Guidelines

### Primary Priority: Good, Readable Content
- **Above all:** Stories should be engaging and well-written
- **Readability:** 16-19 word sentences ensure TV readability with translations
- **Tone:** Teenager-appropriate, accessible, relatable intermediate-advanced level
- **Topic relevance:** Teenage/everyday themes (school, hobbies, friends, family, travel, etc.)

### Secondary Priority: Humour and Engagement
**Use humour where appropriate to make content memorable:**

**Appropriate humour themes:**
- School situations (forgetting homework, boring classes, strict teachers)
- Teenage experiences (social media mishaps, friendship drama)
- Family moments (embarrassing parents, sibling arguments)
- Learning mistakes (practice making errors, funny misunderstandings)

**Humour principles:**
- Gentle wit that students will recognise
- Playful commentary on teenage life
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, mocking, or mean-spirited content

### Tertiary Priority: Seasonal References (OPTIONAL, Not Required)
**Seasonal content is OPTIONAL — do not force it**

**If using seasonal references:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Better non-seasonal than weak seasonal:**
- ✅ Excellent non-seasonal content about study habits
- ❌ Weak seasonal reference about Christmas in July (forced and confusing)

### Topic Flexibility
**Stories can be about ANY teenage/everyday topic:**
- School life and education
- Hobbies and interests
- Family and friends
- Travel and transportation
- Technology and social media
- Health and lifestyle
- Future goals and dreams

**Quality principle:** Theme flexibility allows creators to choose topics they can write well about

- [ ] **Cohesive narrative** about a specific topic
- [ ] **Emoji + English + Japanese** format on all 10 lines
- [ ] No blank lines within story sentences

#### ✅ Discussion Questions (Lines 11-20)

---

### Question Format Options (Clarified)

#### Discussion Questions (Lines 11-20) — Stand-Alone Personal Opinion Prompts

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** Questions are NOT reading comprehension tests that require reading the story. Questions are stand-alone personal discussion prompts about the THEME that ANY student can answer from their own knowledge and opinion.

#### Question Types Supported (All should be about the THEME):

1. **Yes/No Questions with Should/Ought**
   - Example: "Should students study harder for important exams?"
   - Test: Moral reasoning, obligation language

2. **What Questions (Open-ended)**
   - Example: "What subjects do you find most difficult at school?"
   - Test: Personal preference, domain vocabulary

3. **How Questions (Process/Method)**
   - Example: "How do you prepare for important university entrance exams?"
   - Test: Process description, passive voice (actions received)

4. **Why Questions (Reasoning)**
   - Example: "Why do you think homework is assigned to students every day?"
   - Test: Causal reasoning, passive voice understanding

5. **Which Questions (Preference/Selection)**
   - Example: "Which season do you prefer for outdoor activities?"
   - Test: Preference vocabulary, seasonal concepts

6. **When Questions (Timing/Frequency)**
   - Example: "When do you usually study for your exams?"
   - Test: Time expressions, daily routines

7. **Conditional Questions (2nd Conditional)**
   - Example: "What would you do if you had more free time?"
   - Test: Counterfactual reasoning, conditional structures

#### Question Grammar Requirements:

- **Length:** 16-19 words per question (TV-readable constraint)
- **Format:** Question mark (?) at the end for ALL questions
- **Context-independent:** Must be answerable WITHOUT reading the story first
- **Theme-aligned:** Questions must be about the monthly THEME (school, family, travel, food, etc.), NOT about the specific story content
- **Japanese translation:** EVERY question (Lines 11-20) MUST have a Japanese translation

#### Example Question Sets by Theme:

**School Life Theme:**
```
🎓 Do you think homework should be given to students every day?
あなたは毎日宿題を生徒に出すべきだと思いますか？

📚 Which subject do you find most difficult at school?
学校でどの科目が一番難しいと思いますか？

😄 How do you prepare for important exams?
あなたは重要な試験の準備をどのようにしますか？

📖 Why are libraries important for students?
なぜ図書館は生徒にとって重要ですか？

⏰ When do you usually study for your lessons?
あなたはいつ通常授業の勉強をしますか？

💡 What would happen if schools closed for a week?
もし学校が一週間閉鎖されたらどうなると思いますか？
```

**Family & Relationships Theme:**

```

😊 Question 1 in English (16-19 words)?
日本語の翻訳1？

📚 Question 2 in English (16-19 words)?
日本語の翻訳2？

[... 8 more questions with Japanese translations ...]
```

**Key Points:**
- Each question starts with an emoji
- English question (16-19 words)
- Question mark (?) at the end of English line
- Japanese translation on the next line
- Question mark (?) at the end of Japanese line
- No blank lines between questions

## Appendix D: Pre-2 Plus Key Insight — PASSIVE EXPLOSION

### Why Pre-2 Plus is Different

**Data from Eiken analysis:**
- 準2級: Passive voice = 5 occurrences (minimal, just introduction)
- Pre-2 Plus: Passive voice = 20 occurrences (+300% jump)
- This is the LARGEST single grammar increase in the entire Eiken progression

**What this means for teaching:**
- Pre-2 Plus is NOT "slightly harder 準2級"
- Pre-2 Plus is a PARADIGM SHIFT to passive voice dominance
- Students who cannot recognise passive forms will fail reading comprehension
- Stories MUST prioritise passive voice over other features

**Curriculum implementation:**
- 8-12 passive sentences per story (out of 10 total story sentences)
- ALL passive tenses: present, past, present perfect, past perfect, future
- Passive voice is the FIRST priority, 2nd conditionals are SECOND
- Modals and reported speech are supporting features

**Verification rule:** If a story has fewer than 8 passive sentences, it REJECTS automatically. Passive dominance is non-negotiable at Pre-2 Plus level.
