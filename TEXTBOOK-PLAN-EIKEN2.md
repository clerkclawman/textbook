# Eiken Grade 2 — 48-Story Master Plan

**Created:** 24 February 2026  
**Based on:** SPEC-EIKEN2-ALIGNED.md Version 1.0  
**Total Stories:** 48 (4 stories/month × 12 months)  
**Curriculum Duration:** 12 months (48 weeks)

---

## 1. Overview

### Curriculum Summary
- **Total stories:** 48 (Weeks 1-48)
- **Format per story:** 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **Sentence length:** 10-15 words average (TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously)
- **ALL lines (1-20):** Emoji + English (10-15 words) + Japanese translation

**⚠️ CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE: NO PROGRESSION**

**All 48 stories are at the SAME Grade 2 difficulty level.** No progressive building to "mastery."

**Why No Progression:**
- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Weekly Changes = Variety Only (NOT Progression):**
- Rotation pattern: MIXED weeks alternate with focused grammar weeks
- Grammar focus rotates through: Mixed Conditionals → Reported Speech → Noun Clauses → Academic Passive
- Different themes for variety (environmental issues, scientific discovery, education reform, economics, technology, etc.)
- NO "integration phase" or "mastery phase"

**Every Single Story (Weeks 1-48) Must Have:**
- Grade 2 vocabulary (2,447-word scope)
- Academic passive: **5-8 sentences (MANDATORY)** — Lines 1-5 FORCED PASSIVE
- In focus weeks: 8-10 instances of the target grammar feature
- In MIXED weeks: Variety of grammar types (no single feature requirement)
- Sentence length: 10-15 words (max 20)
- Japanese translations: ALL 20 lines

### Story Structure
**Lines 1-10:** Story sentences (academic/professional content about a theme)  
**Lines 11-20:** Discussion questions (stand-alone personal opinion prompts about the theme)

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE:** ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS

**Format:**
```
😊 English sentence or question (10-15 words).
日本語の翻訳
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL PASSIVE REQUIREMENT (Non-Negotiable):**

**Lines 1-5 MUST BE PASSIVE:**
```
Line 1: MUST BE PASSIVE ("was/were [verb]ed" or "is/are [verb]ed")
Line 2: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 3: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 4: MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 5: MUST BE PASSIVE
```

This ensures 5-8 passive sentences minimum in every story (MANDATORY).

### Grade 2 Profile (From Test Reality)
- **Vocabulary:** 2,447 unique words (+16% from 準2級プラス)
- **Mixed conditionals:** NEW at Grade 2 (past condition + present result, present condition + past result)
- **Advanced reported speech:** Extension from 準2級プラス (multi-level reporting, reported questions, reported commands)
- **Noun clauses:** NEW at Grade 2 (question-word clauses, that-clauses, if/whether clauses)
- **Academic passive:** Continued emphasis for objectivity

| **November** | 41-44 | Story 41-44 | Sustainable Development |
| **December** | 45-48 | Story 45-48 | Global Challenges |

**Verification Rule:** Each story's theme should align with its month's focus.

## 7. Content Quality Guidelines

### Primary Priority: Good, Readable Content
- **Above all:** Stories should be engaging and well-written  
- **Readability:** 10-15 word sentences ensure TV readability with translations  
- **Academic tone:** Professional but not dry, formal but accessible  
- **Topic relevance:** Academic/professional themes (environment, science, education, economics, technology, politics, etc.)

### Secondary Priority: Humour and Engagement
**Use humour where appropriate to make content memorable:**

**Appropriate humour themes:**
- Conference presentation anxiety
- Research funding struggles
- Academic publishing delays
- Environmental policy contradictions
- Technology failures
- Student procrastination

**Humour principles:**
- Gentle wit that students will recognise
- Irony about real academic situations
- Playful commentary students relate to
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, mocking, or mean-spirited content

**When to use humour:**
- Opening lines can grab attention
- Examples can be playful
- Conclusions can warm the tone  
- **When to avoid:** Serious topics like inequality, disaster, tragedy

### Tertiary Priority: Seasonal References (OPTIONAL, Not Required)
**Seasonal content is OPTIONAL — do not force it**

**If using seasonal references:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Better non-seasonal than weak seasonal
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial
