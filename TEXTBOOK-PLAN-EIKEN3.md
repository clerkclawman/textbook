# Eiken Grade 3 — 48-Story Master Plan

**Created:** 23 February 2026  
**Based on:** SPEC-EIKEN3-ALIGNED.md Version 1.0  
**Total Stories:** 48 (4 stories/month × 12 months)  
**Curriculum Duration:** 12 months (48 weeks)

---

## 1. Overview

### Curriculum Summary
- **Total stories:** 48 (Weeks 1-48)
- **Format per story:** 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **Sentence length:** 10-13 words average (TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously)
- **ALL lines (1-20):** Emoji + English (10-13 words) + Japanese translation

**⚠️ CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE: NO PROGRESSION**

**All 48 stories are at the SAME Grade 3 difficulty level.** No progressive building to "mastery."

**Why No Progression:**
- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Weekly Pattern Rotation (STRICT):**
- Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47: **MIXED** (all three features)
- Weeks 2, 8, 14, 18, 24, 30, 34, 40, 48: **Present Perfect Focus** (6-8 instances)
- Weeks 4, 10, 16, 20, 26, 32, 36, 42: **Relative Clauses Focus** (6-8 instances)
- Weeks 6, 12, 22, 28, 38, 44, 46: **Passive Voice Focus** (6-8 instances)

**Every Single Story (Weeks 1-48) Must Have:**
- MIXED weeks: Present Perfect (2-4), Relative Clauses (2-4), Passive Voice (1-3)
- Present Perfect Focus weeks: Present Perfect (4-6 instances)
- Relative Clauses Focus weeks: Relative Clauses (4-6 instances)
- Passive Voice Focus weeks: Passive Voice (3-5 instances)
- Sentence length: 10-13 words (max 20)
- Japanese translations: ALL 20 lines

This makes infinite content generation possible for a real skill — any week can be a student's first or last at Grade 3 level.

### Story Structure
**Lines 1-10:** Story sentences (everyday content about a theme)  
**Lines 11-20:** Discussion questions (stand-alone personal opinion prompts about the theme)

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE:** ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS

**Format:**
```
😊 English sentence or question (10-13 words).
日本語の翻訳
```

### Grade 3 Profile (From Test Reality)
- **Vocabulary:** 1,156 unique words (+23% from 4級)
- **Three Pillars:** Present Perfect (introductory), Relative Clauses (defining only), Passive Voice (basic forms)
- **Test Reality:** Features intro but NOT dominant (2 occurrences each in actual exams)
- **Sentence Length:** 10-13 words (TV-readable constraint)
- **Content Type:** Everyday topics (school, family, hobbies, seasons)

## 5. Content Quality Guidelines

### Primary Priority: Good, Readable Content
- **Above all:** Stories should be engaging and well-written  
- **Readability:** 10-13 word sentences ensure TV readability with translations  
- **Everyday tone:** Friendly, relatable, simple but not childish  
- **Topic relevance:** Everyday themes (school, family, hobbies, seasons, friends) suitable for junior high students

### Secondary Priority: Humour and Engagement
**Use humour where appropriate to make content memorable:**

**Appropriate humour themes:**
- Funny homework mistakes and mix-ups
- Forgetting important dates or items
- Unexpected discoveries in school bags
- Relatable moments with friends and family
- Playful observations about everyday situations
- Gentle irony about school life

**Humour principles:**
- Light, warm, and inclusive tone
- Recognizable situations students experience
- Avoid sarcasm, cynicism, or mean-spirited content  
- Keep it friendly and relatable

**When to use humour:**
- Opening lines can grab attention
- Examples can be playful
- Conclusions can warm the tone  
- **When to avoid:** Serious topics like natural disasters, accidents

### Tertiary Priority: Seasonal References (OPTIONAL, Not Required)
**Seasonal content is OPTIONAL — do not force it**

**If using seasonal references:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month:
  - New Year: January
  - Setsubun: February (Feb 3)
  - Valentine's Day: February (Feb 14)
  - White Day: March (Mar 14)
  - Cherry blossoms: March-April
  - New school year: April
  - Golden Week: May
  - Rainy season: June
  - Tanabata: July (Jul 7)
  - Obon: August (mid-August)
  - Halloween: October (Oct 31)
  - Christmas: December (Dec 25)
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Better non-seasonal than weak seasonal:**
- ✅ Excellent non-seasonal content about hobbies  
- ❌ Weak seasonal reference about Christmas in July (forced and confusing)

### Topic Flexibility
**Stories can be about ANY everyday topic:**
- School life (classmates, teachers, homework, subjects)
- Family (parents, siblings, celebrations, routines)
- Hobbies (sports, music, games, reading, drawing)
- Friends (playing together, birthdays, helping each other)
- Seasons (weather, festivals, activities)
- Food (meals, cooking, seasonal dishes)

**Quality principle:** Theme flexibility allows creators to choose topics they can write well about

## Appendix D: Common Errors to Avoid

### ❌ WRONG Format Examples

**1. Missing Japanese on Questions (MAJOR ERROR):**
```javascript
❌ // WRONG — Questions 11-20 lack Japanese translations
content: `🎓 Question 1 in English?
📚 Question 2 in English?
[... questions without Japanese ...]`
```

**2. Extra Properties in Object:**
```javascript
❌ // WRONG — Too many properties
{
  title: "Story 1",
  week: 1,
  theme: "School",
  grammarFocus: "MIXED",
  content: "..."
}
```

**3. String Concatenation Instead of Backticks:**
```javascript
❌ // WRONG — Using + instead of template literal
content: "Line 1\n" + "日本\n" + "Line 2\n" + "日本語\n"
```

### ✅ CORRECT Format Examples

**1. All Lines with Japanese (CORRECT):**
```javascript
✅ // CORRECT — ALL 20 lines have Japanese
content: `😊 Story sentence.
日本語。

🎓 Question 1 in English?
日本語の質問1？

📚 Question 2 in English?
日本語の質問2？`
```

**2. Simple Object Structure (CORRECT):**
```javascript
✅ // CORRECT — Only title and content
{
  title: "1. Story Title (MIXED)",
  content: `😊 Story sentence.
日本語。

🎓 Question?
日本語？`
}
```

**3. Template Literal Backticks (CORRECT):**
```javascript
✅ // CORRECT — Using ` template literal
content: `😊 Story sentence 1.
日本語1。

😊 Story sentence 2.
日本語2。`
```
