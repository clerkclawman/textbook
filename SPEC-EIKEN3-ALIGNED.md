**Data sources:** [eiken-resources/eiken-synthesis.md](eiken-resources/eiken-synthesis.md), [eiken-resources/QUICK-REFERENCE.md](eiken-resources/QUICK-REFERENCE.md), [analysis-results.json](eiken-resources/eiken-analysis-deepseek/analysis-results.json), [comprehensive-grammar-summary.md](eiken-resources/eiken-analysis/comprehensive-grammar-summary.md)  
**Target:** 48 stories over 12-month curriculum (4 stories/month × 12 months)

## 1. Level Overview — Grade 3 Summary

### Profile
- **Official Description:** Everyday situations, communication at junior high school graduation level
- **Test Reality:** Transitional level previewing advanced features — present perfect, relative clauses, and basic passive are introduced but not dominant
- **Vocabulary Scope:** 1,156 unique words (23% increase from 4級's 937)
- **Sentence Length:** 10-15 words average (TV-readable with translations)
- **Proficiency Level:** Junior high school graduation — bridge to intermediate level
- **Critical Constraint:** Sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously

### Critical Transition: 4級 → 3級

This is the **third transition point** in the Eiken progression:

| Metric | 4級 | 3級 | Change | Significance |
|--------|-----|-----|--------|--------------|
| Vocabulary | 937 | 1,156 | +23% | Moderate vocabulary expansion |
| Sentence length | 12-14 words | 10-15 words | 0% | **TV-readable constraint applies to all levels** |
| **Present perfect** | None | **Introduced** (2 occurrences) | NEW | Basic exposure only |
| **Relative clauses** | Minimal | **Introduced** | NEW | Preview of 準2級 complexity |
| **Passive voice** | None | **Introduced** (2 occurrences) | NEW | Basic forms only |
| Reading passages | Present | **More complex** | + | Multiple sentences per passage |

**Note on Sentence Length:** Whilst actual Grade 3 exams use 14-16 word sentences, this curriculum uses 10-15 words to ensure TV readability with translations. Grammar complexity is maintained through strategic use of present perfect, relative clauses, and passive voice, not through longer sentences.

### What Makes Grade 3 Different

**Unlike 4級:**
1. **Present perfect emerges** — Distinguishes past events from present relevance (*I have been to Tokyo* vs. *I went to Tokyo*)
2. **Relative clauses begin** — Adding information about people/places/things (*The boy who likes football*)
3. **Basic passive voice** — Shifting focus from doer to receiver (*The cake was eaten*)
4. **More complex narratives** — Multiple-sentence stories with cause-effect relationships
5. **Balanced tense usage** — Equal weight on past, present, and future contexts

**Unlike 準2級:**
1. **Features are previewed only** — Not tested heavily (2 occurrences each for present perfect/passive)
2. **Modals NOT dominant** — That's the next level's feature (88 occurrences at 準2級)
3. **Simpler relative clauses** — Mostly defining clauses (*the man who lives here*), not complex embedding
4. **Everyday narratives** — Stories about daily life, not abstract/professional topics

## 2. Test Reality Summary — What Eiken Analysis Shows

### The Official Description vs. Test Reality Gap

| Official Description | Test Reality | Impact on Teaching |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Everyday situations" | **Preview of advanced features** (present perfect, relative clauses, passive) | Don't over-emphasise—these are introductory, not core |
| "Junior high graduation level" | **Transitional, not mastery** | Focus on recognition and basic use, not deep mastery |
| "Simple communication" | **More complex than 4級** | Reading passages with multiple sentences, not simple Q&A |

### Three Pillars of Grade 3 Success

#### 1. Present Perfect (Introduction — Minimal Testing)

**What the data shows:**
- Present perfect introduced with only 2 occurrences in Grade 3 exams
- NOT a dominant feature (explodes later at 準2級 for modals, but present perfect itself remains light)
- Basic forms: *have/has + past participle*
- Primary uses: Experiences (*I have visited*), Recent past (*I have just finished*)

**Teaching priority:**
- Recognition first (can students identify present perfect?)
- Basic production (simple sentences, not complex nuances)
- Distinguish from past simple (*I went* vs. *I have gone*)
- Don't over-teach — this is an introduction, not mastery

#### 2. Relative Clauses (Introduction — Foundation Building)

**Primary forms used:**
- Defining relative clauses (*The boy who plays tennis*)
- *who/that* for people (*The teacher who teaches English*)
- *which/that* for things (*The book that I read*)
- Basic placement: relative clause follows the noun it describes

**Test evidence:**
- Introduced but minimal testing
- Focus on defining clauses (essential meaning), not extra information
- No complex punctuation with non-defining clauses

**Teaching priority:**
- Simple identification: which noun is being modified?
- Basic structure: noun + relative pronoun + clause
- Defining vs. non-defining (briefly — focus on defining first)
- No complex embedding within relative clauses

#### 3. Basic Passive Voice (Introduction — Concept Only)

**Limited forms:**
- Present passive: *is/are + past participle* (*The window is opened*)
- Past passive: *was/were + past participle* (*The cake was eaten*)
- No perfect passive, no passive modals

**Test evidence:**
- Only 2 occurrences in Grade 3 exams
- Concept introduction, not dominant feature
- Passive explosion is at 準2級プラス (+300% jump)

**Teaching priority:**
- Understand the concept: action received, not performed
- Recognise *is/are/was/were + [verb]ed* pattern
- Basic production with simple sentences
- Don't over-emphasise — this is preview only

### The Transitional Nature of Grade 3

**Current teaching gap:**
- Many Grade 3 resources treat present perfect, relative clauses, and passive as core mastery features
- Test reality shows they're introductory only (2 occurrences each)
- Students waste time mastering features that will be tested heavily at higher levels

**Evidence from analysis:**
- Present perfect at Grade 3: 2 occurrences (minimal)
- Present perfect at 準2級: Still moderate (modals are 88 occurrences, NOT present perfect)
- Relative clauses at Grade 3: Introduced (defining only)
- Relative clauses at 準2級プラス: Non-defining introduced, more complex
- Passive at Grade 3: 2 occurrences (basic present/past)
- Passive at 準2級プラス: 20 occurrences (+300% jump, ALL tenses)

**Teaching priority should reflect:**
- Present perfect: Recognition + basic use (don't over-teach nuances)
- Relative clauses: Basic defining clauses (who/that for people, which/that for things)
- Passive voice: Concept understanding + simple forms (present/past only)

## 6. Seasonal & Cultural Context

### Overview

This section provides seasonal and cultural context for the Grade 3 curriculum. Seasonal references are **OPTIONAL**, not mandatory.

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Good, readable content** — Most important
2. **Engaging, relatable material** — Humour is ideal when appropriate
3. **Seasonal alignment** — Optional; if included, must align to correct month

**For Grade 3:** Stories should be about everyday life, school, family, hobbies, and seasonal activities. Topics are personal and relatable to junior high school students. Seasonal events create memorable context when used naturally, but should never be forced.

**Content Quality Principles:**
- Better to have excellent non-seasonal content than weak seasonal references
- Humour and engagement are more valuable than seasonal accuracy
- Students learn better when content is interesting and relatable
- Seasonal events create memorable context when used naturally, but not required

### Seasonal Alignment Policy (SIMPLIFIED)

**Seasonal Content: OPTIONAL, Not Required**

Stories may include seasonal references, but this is not mandatory:
- **Primary Priority:** Good, readable, engaging content
- **Secondary Priority:** Humour and wit make content memorable
- **Tertiary Priority:** Seasonal alignment (if relevant to topic)

**When Using Seasonal References:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month:
  - New Year: January
  - Setsubun: February
  - Valentine's Day: February
  - White Day: March
  - Cherry blossoms (sakura): March-April
  - New school year: April
  - Golden Week: May
  - Rainy season: June
  - Tanabata: July
  - Obon: August
  - Back to school: September
  - Halloween: October
  - Christmas: December
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Examples of Acceptable Seasonal References:**
- January story about New Year → mentions resolutions and celebrations
- April story about school → mentions new classmates and spring term
- June story about weather → mentions rainy season
- December story about winter → mentions Christmas and year-end holidays

**Examples of Unforced (Non-Seasonal) Stories:**
- Daily routines (morning, school, afternoon) - any month
- Hobbies and interests (sports, music, games) - any month
- Family activities (weekends, holidays) - any month
- School subjects and homework - any month

**Humour Integration (IDEAL):**
Where appropriate, include subtle wit or humour:
- Gentle irony about everyday situations
- Relatable moments students recognize
- Playful observations about school life
- Avoid sarcasm or cynicism — keep it warm and relevant

### Cultural Awareness Guidelines

#### 1. Japanese Seasonal Context (Primary)

**Primary context:** Japanese seasonal events and school calendar

**Why Japanese focus for Grade 3:**
- Grade 3 students are typically in junior high school in Japan
- Direct experience with Japanese seasons makes content relatable
- School calendar aligned to Japanese academic year (April start)
- Familiar celebrations create instant engagement

**Implementation guidelines:**
- Reference specific Japanese festivals (Setsubun, Tanabata, Obon)
- Use accurate dates and traditional practices
- Connect to students' lived experiences (new school year in April, Golden Week holidays)
- Avoid exoticising Japanese culture — treat it as normal, everyday life

**Example Japanese framing:**
> "Tanabata is on July 7th. I have written a wish on a colourful paper. The wish is hung on a bamboo tree."

#### 2. International Perspectives (Optional)

**Why international context is optional:**
- Grade 3 is focused on everyday life, not global topics
- Introducing too many foreign cultures may confuse
- Keep international references brief when used
- Focus on relatable similarities (children play, families gather, seasons change)

**Implementation guidelines (if used):**
- Keep comparisons simple (1-2 sentences max)
- Use familiar international celebrations (Christmas, Halloween)
- Emphasise similarities, not exotic differences
- Avoid detailed explanations of foreign cultures

**Example (if used):**
> "In Japan, we celebrate Setsubun in February. In other countries, people celebrate different festivals too."

#### 3. Avoiding Stereotypes

**Principles:**
- **Specificity over generalisation:** Reference specific festivals or foods, not broad "Japanese culture"
- **Contemporary relevance:** Focus on current practices students know
- **Respectful representation:** Accurate details without exaggeration

**What to avoid:**
- ❌ "Japanese people love sushi and anime"
- ✅ "My family eats sushi on special occasions"

- ❌ "Children always study hard in Japan"
- ✅ "I studied for two hours yesterday"

### Seasonal Vocabulary Integration

**Everyday seasonal terms for Grade 3:**

| Seasonal Category | Vocabulary | Example Context |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **School calendar** | new school year, classmates, teacher, classroom, homework, exam, test | School life stories |
| **Seasons** | spring, summer, autumn, fall, winter, rainy season, hot, cold, warm | Weather descriptions |
| **Festivals** | Setsubun, Tanabata, Obon, Halloween, Christmas, New Year | Celebration stories |
| **Activities** | hanami (flower viewing), travel, swimming, skiing, festival, fireworks | Holiday activities |
| **Time expressions** | now, today, yesterday, tomorrow, last week, next week, this year | Present perfect context |

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce seasonal vocabulary within simple, relatable contexts. Students should encounter terms in stories about activities they recognize and experiences they've had.

---

## 7. Writing Guidelines — Sentence Length, Vocabulary, Complexity

### Sentence Length Requirements (TV-Readable)

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Average sentence length** | 10-13 words per sentence | **TV-readable with translations** |
| **Minimum sentence length** | 8 words | Avoid fragmentation |
| **Maximum sentence length** | 20 words | Strict limit for readability |
| **Sentence length variety** | 8-15 word range | Keep natural flow |
| **Percentage of sentences** (15+ words) | 10-20% | Occasional longer sentences only |

**Critical Constraint:** All sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously. This constraint applies to **all Eiken levels** (5級 through 1級).

**Note:** These targets are for individual sentences (lines 1-10), not total story word count. Each story contains exactly 20 lines.

### Sentence Length Strategy (Maintaining Grade 3 Complexity)

**How to maintain Grade 3 complexity without long sentences:**

1. **Use present perfect for experiences** in short sentences
   - *Instead of:* "During my winter vacation which lasted for two weeks, I visited my grandmother who lives in Hokkaido and it was a wonderful experience that I will never forget." (29 words)
   - *Use:* "I visited my grandmother. She lives in Hokkaido. It was wonderful. I have never forgotten it." (6 + 6 + 5 + 4 words)

2. **Use relative clauses to describe people/things**
   - *Instead of:* "The boy who plays tennis in the park every Saturday afternoon is the same person who sits next to me in class and we become good friends." (27 words)
   - *Use:* "The boy plays tennis. He plays in the park. He sits next to me. We are good friends." (6 + 6 + 6 + 5 words)

3. **Use passive voice for focus**
   - *Instead of:* "The Christmas decorations were made by the children who worked very hard for three days and they looked beautiful in the classroom." (24 words)
   - *Use:* "Decorations were made. Children made them. They worked hard. The room looked beautiful." (4 + 4 + 4 + 5 words)

4. **Keep sentences simple but meaningful**
   - *"I have been to Tokyo. It was exciting."* (5 + 4 words)
   - *"The book which I read was interesting."* (7 words)
   - *"The window is opened by the wind."* (7 words)

### Sentence Length Consistency Across Months

| Months | Target Length | Strategy |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| 1-4 | 10-11 words | Simple sentences, present perfect introduced |
| 5-8 | 11-12 words | Relative clauses more frequent |
| 9-12 | 12-13 words | More passive voice used |
| All months | 10-13 average | Consistent difficulty, no progression |

### Vocabulary Level Requirements

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Total vocabulary scope** | 1,156 words | From Grade 3 analysis |
| **Average per story** | 50-70 unique words | New + recycled vocabulary |
| **Everyday vocabulary** | 80-90% of words | School, family, hobbies, seasons |
| **Seasonal vocabulary** | 5-10% of words | Festivals, weather, activities |
| **Grammar-focused vocabulary** | 5-10% of words | Past participles, relative pronouns |

### Vocabulary Categories by Month

| Months | Domain Focus | Example Domains |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1-4 | School and family | Classmates, teachers, homework, New Year |
| 5-8 | Seasonal activities | Setsubun, Valentine's, Tanabata, festivals |
| 9-12 | Sports and hobbies | Swimming, skiing, music, games, books |

### Tone and Engagement (IDEAL Quality Factors)

**Primary Tone:** Friendly, relatable, everyday language

**Humour (Ideal to Include Where Appropriate):**
- Use gentle wit that students will recognise
- Friendly observations about school life
- Playful commentary on everyday situations
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, mocking, or mean-spirited content

**Engagement Characteristics:**
- Relatable situations students experience
- Memorable examples that stick
- Balanced tone: friendly but not childish, simple but not boring
- Humour should be light, warm, and inclusive

**Example Humor Themes:**
- Funny homework mistakes
- Unexpected things found in school bags
- Forgetting important dates (like homework due dates)
- Surprising discoveries during cleaning
- Funny moments with friends

**When to Use Humour:**
- Opening lines can grab attention
- Examples can be playful
- Conclusions can warm the tone
- **When to avoid:** Serious topics like natural disasters, accidents

### Complexity Requirements (Grade 3 Level)

#### Clause Structure

| Requirement | Target | Example (TV-readable) |
|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Simple sentences** | 50-60% of all sentences | Single independent clause |
| **Present perfect sentences** | 20-30% of all sentences | *I have visited Tokyo* |

| **Passive voice sentences** | 10-20% of all sentences | *The cake was eaten* |
| **Double clauses** | 10-20% | Simple combining only |

**Key Strategy:** Use 2-3 simple sentences instead of 1 long complex sentence. Maintain Grade 3 features (present perfect, relative clauses, passive voice) in short, clear sentences.

**Example Transformation:**
- *Before (long):* "During my summer vacation which was very exciting, I went to the beach where I met my friend and we played together all day long." (26 words)

## 9. Story Structure Format Requirements

### Content Format Requirements

Each story contains 20 lines total:
- **Lines 1-10:** 10 STORY sentences (everyday content) with emoji + English + Japanese
- **Lines 11-20:** 10 DISCUSSION questions (personal opinion prompts) with emoji + English + Japanese

**⚠️ CRITICAL JAPANESE TRANSLATION RULE:**

**ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS**

Lines 1-10 (Story sentences): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)
Lines 11-20 (Questions): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)

**EVERY LINE format:**
```
[Emoji] [English: 10-13 words]
[Japanese translation]
```

**❌ WRONG (missing Japanese on questions):**
```
🎓 Do you like your new school?
📚 What is your favourite subject?
```

**✅ CORRECT (Japanese on ALL lines):**
```
🎓 Do you like your new school?
新しい学校は好きですか？

📚 What is your favourite subject?
一番好きな教科は何ですか？
```

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

**Story Sentences (Lines 1-10):**
- Everyday content about a specific theme (e.g., New Year, school, hobbies, seasons)
- Each sentence is 10-13 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Sentences form a cohesive narrative about an everyday topic
- Grammar features: present perfect, relative clauses, passive voice (depending on week type)

**Discussion Questions (Lines 11-20):**
- **STAND-ALONE personal discussion questions** anyone can answer from their own knowledge/opinion
- Each question is 10-13 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Questions use **similar grammar/vocabulary** to the story but are about the **THEME**, not the story content
- Questions do NOT require reading the story
- Questions are conversation/discussion prompts for students to give personal opinions

**Example from Grade 3 (New School Year story):**

**Story Sentences (about new school year):**
```
📚 I have started my new school today.
今日、新しい学校に通い始めました。

😊 The teacher who teaches English is very kind.
英語を教えてくれる先生はとても親切です。

🎓 My classmates are friendly and we talk a lot.
クラスメートは友好的で、たくさん話します。
[... 7 more story sentences ...]
```

**Discussion Questions (about the theme - school and learning):**
```
🎓 Do you like your new school?
新しい学校は好きですか？

📚 What is your favourite subject?
一番好きな教科は何ですか？

😊 Who is your best friend in class?
クラスで一番の親友は誰ですか？
[... 7 more questions about school, friends, subjects ...]
```

**Pattern:** Same format for ALL 20 lines:
```
😊 English sentence OR question (10-13 words).
日本語の翻訳です。
```

**Key Points:**
- Both story sentences AND discussion questions follow the SAME format
- NO empty lines in the story content
- Each story is exactly 20 lines (10 story sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **ALL lines must be 10-13 words** (TV readable constraint)
- Questions are **personal opinion prompts**, NOT reading comprehension tests

### JSON Code Example

```javascript
{
    title: "1. New School Year (MIXED)",

### Quality Control Checklist

Before finalizing any story, verify:

#### Grammar Verification

- [ ] MIXED weeks: All three features present (2-4 sentences each)
- [ ] Present Perfect Focus weeks: 4-6 present perfect sentences
- [ ] Relative Clauses Focus weeks: 4-6 relative clause sentences
- [ ] Passive Voice Focus weeks: 3-5 passive sentences
- [ ] Sentence length average 10-13 words
- [ ] No sentence exceeds 20 words maximum

#### Vocabulary Verification

- [ ] Vocabulary matches Grade 3 level (1,156-word scope)
- [ ] Everyday vocabulary predominant (80-90%)
- [ ] Past participles correct for present perfect
- [ ] Relative pronouns correct (who/that for people, which/that for things, where for places)

#### Coherence Verification

- [ ] Sentence-to-sentence flow logical
- [ ] Thematic consistency maintained
- [ ] Referential links clear (pronouns)
- [ ] Everyday tone appropriate (friendly, relatable)

#### Length Verification

- [ ] Average sentence length 10-13 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- [ ] No sentence exceeds 20 words maximum
- [ ] Story contains exactly 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 questions)
- [ ] Word count 50-70 unique vocabulary

#### Exam Alignment Verification

- [ ] MIXED weeks: No single feature dominates
- [ ] Focus weeks: Target feature clearly emphasized
- [ ] Everyday topics (not academic/professional like Grade 1)
- [ ] Junior high school appropriate content

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-emphasizing features** → MIXED weeks should have balance, not dominance
2. **Too complex for MIXED weeks** → MIXED is recognition, not mastery
3. **Academic/professional topics** → Grade 3 requires everyday topics, not Grade 1-level themes
4. **Long sentences** → TV readability constraint: **MAX 13 words average, 20 words maximum**
5. **Missing Japanese translations** → ALL 20 lines must have Japanese translations (MAJOR ERROR)
6. **Comprehension questions** → Questions must be personal opinion prompts, not reading comprehension tests
7. **Questions about story content** → Questions must be about THEME, not story details
8. **Forcing seasonal references** → Seasonal is optional; quality comes first
