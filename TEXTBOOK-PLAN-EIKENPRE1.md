# Eiken Grade Pre-1 — 48-Story Master Plan

**Created:** 24 February 2026
**Based on:** SPEC-EIKENPRE1-ALIGNED.md
**Total Stories:** 48 (4 stories/month × 12 months)
**Curriculum Duration:** 12 months (48 weeks)

---

## 1. Overview

### Curriculum Summary
- **Total stories:** 48 (Weeks 1-48)
- **Format per story:** 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **Sentence length:** 10-15 words average (TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously)
- **ALL lines (1-20):** Emoji + English (10-15 words) + Japanese translation

### ⚠️ CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE: FAIR ROTATION (NO PROGRESSION)

**All 48 stories are at the SAME Grade Pre-1 difficulty level.** No progressive building to "mastery."

**Why No Progression:**
- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Weekly Pattern (Repeat throughout):**
```
Week 1: MIXED (discourse markers present throughout)
Week 2: Focus: Discourse Markers - Addition (moreover, furthermore, in addition)
Week 3: MIXED
Week 4: Focus: Discourse Markers - Contrast (however, nevertheless, on the other hand)
Week 5: MIXED
Week 6: Focus: Discourse Markers - Consequence (therefore, consequently, as a result)
Week 7: MIXED
Week 8: Focus: Academic Register
[rotate through all 48 weeks]
```

**CRITICAL: Discourse markers emphasized (minimum 6-8 per story)**

**Every Single Story (Weeks 1-48) Must Have:**
- Discourse markers: **6-8 instances (STRICT MINIMUM)** — THE critical feature for Pre-1
- Academic register: Formal tone throughout
- Sentence length: 10-15 words (max 20)
- Japanese translations: ALL 20 lines

### Story Structure
**Lines 1-10:** Story sentences (academic/professional content about a theme)
**Lines 11-20:** Discussion questions (stand-alone personal opinion prompts about the theme)

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE:** ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS

**Format:**
```
😊 English sentence or question (10-15 words).
日本語の翻訳
```

### Grammar Difficulty Strategy
To maintain Pre-1 complexity within TV-readable 10-15 word sentences, use 2-3 short sentences with discourse markers instead of 1 long complex sentence with deep embedding.

**Example:**
- Long sentence (22 words): *"Moreover, because the university has expanded its online programmes, students now have greater flexibility in their study schedules."*
- TV-readable (12 words total): *"Moreover, universities are expanding online programmes. Students now have greater flexibility."*

### Grade Pre-1 Profile (From Test Reality)
- **Vocabulary:** 3,613 unique words (+49% from 2級)
- **Discourse markers:** Core differentiator from 2級 — THE #1 tested feature
- **Academic register:** Required for academic reading/writing
- **Complex linking:** Supports coherence beyond basic conjunctions

- **Target:** 6-8 instances per story
- **Minimum:** 6 discourse markers required (do NOT use fewer than 6)
- **Maximum:** 8 discourse markers to avoid over-use
- **Focus weeks:** Emphasise specific marker types (Addition, Contrast, Consequence)
- **MIXED weeks:** Include variety of all discourse types

**Discourse Marker Examples:**
- *"Moreover, universities are expanding online programmes."* (Addition)
- *"However, some students prefer traditional classrooms."* (Contrast)

- **Nominalisation:** Verbs → nouns (Week 8 focus)
- **Latinate vocabulary:** *examine, investigate, demonstrate*
- **Academic passive:** *It is argued that...*, *Studies have shown...* (Week 8 focus)

**Academic vs. Non-Academic:**
- Non-academic: "I think this problem is bad."

### All Sentences: 10-15 Words Maximum (TV-Readable Constraint)
- **Average:** 10-15 words per sentence
- **Maximum:** 20 words per sentence (hard limit)
- **Apply to:** ALL 20 lines (both story sentences AND discussion questions)

### Grammar Complexity Strategy
Use 2-3 short sentences with discourse markers instead of deep embedding:

**Before (too long):** *"Furthermore, whilst evidence suggests that students benefit from online learning, some studies have shown that face-to-face interaction has advantages."* (21 words)

**After (TV-readable):** *"Furthermore, students benefit from online learning. Evidence suggests this is effective."* (11 + 5 = 16 words total, 2 sentences)

## 6. Content Quality Guidelines

### Primary Priority: Good, Readable Content
- **Above all:** Stories should be engaging and well-written
- **Readability:** 10-15 word sentences ensure TV readability with translations
- **Academic tone:** Professional but not dry, formal but accessible
- **Topic relevance:** Academic/professional themes (research, education, technology, environment, policy, etc.)

### Secondary Priority: Humour and Engagement
**Use humour where appropriate to make content memorable:**

**Appropriate humour themes:**
- Academic bureaucracy delays and absurdities
- Perfect research plans that inevitably change
- Student procrastination and deadline madness
- Group project dynamics (everyone loves group work)
- Conference presentation anxiety
- Reviewer feedback being politely brutal

**Humour principles:**
- Gentle wit that university students will recognise
- Irony about real academic situations
- Playful commentary students relate to
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, mocking, or mean-spirited content

**When to use humour:**
- Opening lines can grab attention
- Examples can be playful
- Conclusions can warm the tone
- **When to avoid:** Serious topics like inequality, discrimination, tragedy

### Tertiary Priority: Seasonal References (OPTIONAL, Not Required)
**Seasonal content is OPTIONAL — do not force it**

**If using seasonal references:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month:
  - Cherry blossoms: March-April
  - Christmas: December
  - Halloween: October
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Better non-seasonal than weak seasonal:**
- ✅ Excellent non-seasonal content about climate research
- ❌ Weak seasonal reference about Christmas in July (forced and confusing)

### Topic Flexibility
**Stories can be about ANY academic/professional topic:**
- Academic research and methodology
- Higher education systems
- Scientific inquiry and evidence
- Technology development and ethics
- Environmental studies and sustainability
- Public policy and governance
- International relations and diplomacy
- Economic analysis and markets
- Social sciences and society
- Medical research and healthcare
- Humanities, arts, philosophy
- Global issues and challenges

**Quality principle:** Theme flexibility allows creators to choose topics they can write well about

- **No empty lines within story content** (all 20 lines should be story sentences or questions)
- **Story numbering in title:** "1.", "2.", etc. for easy reference
- **Discourse focus in title:** Indicate the discourse type being emphasised

## Monthly Progression Structure

Each month follows this pattern:

### Week 1-3: Primary + Secondary Focus
- **Week 1:** MIXED (all discourse types) — Review from previous months
- **Week 2:** Focus on specific discourse marker category
  - Jan/Feb: Addition
  - Mar/Apr: Contrast
  - May/Jun: Consequence
  - Jul/Aug: Conclusion + MIXED
  - Sep-Dec: ALL TYPES mixed
- **Week 3:** MIXED (all discourse types) — Application of focused markers

### Week 4: MIXED Practice Week
- All discourse marker types allowed
- Emphasis on natural usage in context
- Integration with academic register features

### Weekly Focus Clarification
- **MIXED weeks:** Encourage variety of discourse markers across all categories
- **Focus weeks:** Primary emphasis on the specified category, but secondary markers allowed
- **Week 4**: Practice week — students should demonstrate ability to use ALL discourse markers appropriately

### Critical Rule
**NEVER generate content without a plan document first.**
This plan (TEXTBOOK-PLAN-EIKENPRE1.md) is the single source of truth for what each story must contain. All content generation must reference this plan.
