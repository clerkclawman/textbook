# Eiken Grade 4 Level Specification
## Aligned to Test Reality — Not Official Descriptions

**Created:** 23 February 2026  
**Based on:** Analysis of 2025 Eiken exams (第1-3回), 78 PDFs  
**Data sources:** [eiken-synthesis.md](../eiken-resources/eiken-synthesis.md), [QUICK-REFERENCE.md](../eiken-resources/QUICK-REFERENCE.md), [analysis-results.json](../eiken-resources/eiken-analysis-deepseek/analysis-results.json), [comprehensive-grammar-summary.md](../eiken-resources/eiken-analysis/comprehensive-grammar-summary.md)  
**Target:** 48 stories over 12-month curriculum (4 stories/month × 12 months)

---

## 1. Level Overview — Grade 4 Summary

### Profile
- **Official Description:** Simple English for basic communication
- **Test Reality:** Past/future tenses with reading passages — **basic-intermediate, not "simple"**
- **Vocabulary Scope:** 937 unique words (71% jump from 5級's 558)
- **Sentence Length:** 12-14 words average (TV-readable with translations)
- **Proficiency Level:** Lower-intermediate — foundational past/future skills
- **Critical Constraint:** Sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously

### Critical Transition: 5級 → 4級

This is the **1st major transition point** in the Eiken progression:

| Metric | 5級 | 4級 | Change | Significance |
|--------|-----|-----|--------|--------------|
| Vocabulary | 558 | 937 | +71% | **Largest % jump of any level transition** |
| Sentence length | 10-12 words | 12-14 words | +20% | Reading passages increase complexity |
| **Past simple** | Minimal | **Major feature** (36 occurrences) | NEW | Core skill for Grade 4 |
| **Future with will** | Minimal | **Major feature** (29 occurrences) | NEW | Core skill for Grade 4 |
| **Comparatives** | Minimal | **Major feature** | NEW | Core skill for Grade 4 |
| Reading passages | Single sentences | **Multi-sentence passages** | NEW | Reading comprehension becomes critical |

**Note on Sentence Length:** Whilst actual Grade 4 exams use slightly shorter sentences than this curriculum, we use 12-14 words to ensure TV readability with translations. Grammar complexity is maintained through past/future tenses and comparative structures.

### What Makes Grade 4 Different

**Unlike 5級:**
1. **Past tense mastery** — Can narrate events that happened
2. **Future planning** — Can discuss plans and predictions
3. **Comparison skills** — Can compare items, people, places
4. **Reading passages** — Multi-sentence texts require comprehension
5. **Vocabulary expansion** — 71% increase in required vocabulary

**Continuing from 5級:**
- Present continuous remains useful
- Basic sentence structure (SVO)
- Question forms (Wh-questions, yes/no)

## 2. Test Reality Summary — What Eiken Analysis Shows

### The Official Description vs. Test Reality Gap

| Official Description | Test Reality | Impact on Teaching |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Simple English" | **Past simple, future with will, and comparatives are the core differentiators** | Teach time concepts, not just "basic communication" |
| "Basic situations" | **Reading passages with multi-sentence texts** | Students need comprehension skills, not just isolated sentences |
| "Elementary vocabulary" | **937 words required (71% jump from 5級)** | Vocabulary expansion is critical |

### Four Pillars of Grade 4 Success

#### 1. Past Simple Tense (CRITICAL — Core Skill)

**What the data shows:**
- Past simple occurs 36 times in Grade 4 exams
- This is the **first major grammar feature** tested extensively
- Regular and irregular past forms both important
- Time expressions crucial (*yesterday, last week, ago*)

**Test evidence:**
- 5級: Past tense minimal (focus on present continuous)
- 4級: Past simple dominant (36 occurrences)

#### 2. Future with Will (Core Skill)

**Key uses:**
- Predictions (*It will rain tomorrow*)
- Spontaneous decisions (*I'll help you*)
- Promises (*I'll call you later*)
- Future time expressions (*next week, soon, in the future*)

**Frequency:** 29 occurrences in Grade 4 exams

#### 3. Comparative Structures (Core Skill)

**Key forms:**
- Comparatives with -er/more (*bigger, more expensive*)
- Superlatives with -est/most (*biggest, most expensive*)
- Comparative phrases (*as...as*, *not as...as*)
- Quantifiers for comparison (*more than, less than*)

**Test evidence:**
- Comparatives are introduced at Grade 4
- Essential for comparing people, places, things

#### 4. Reading Comprehension (New Feature)

**What's different from 5級:**
- 5級: Single-sentence questions
- 4級: **Multi-sentence passages** requiring comprehension
- Inference and detail retrieval required
- Questions ask about passage content, not just isolated sentences

### The "Simple English" Misconception

**Current curriculum gap:**
- Many resources treat Grade 4 as "very basic"
- The 71% vocabulary jump and reading passages suggest otherwise
- Grade 4 is **basic-intermediate**, not beginner

**Evidence from analysis:**
- 5級 → 4級 is the **largest % vocabulary jump** (71%) of ANY transition
- Reading passages introduce significant complexity
- Three major grammar features (past, future, comparatives) all emerge at this level

## 3. Grammar Priorities — Ranked by Test Reality

### Tier 1: Non-Negotiable (12-16 stories each)

| Priority | Feature | Why Critical | Story Allocation |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **#1** | **Past simple tense** | Core differentiator from 5級; 36 occurrences | **16 stories** (33% of curriculum) |
| **#2** | **Future with will** | Core feature for expressing future; 29 occurrences | **16 stories** (33% of curriculum) |
| **#3** | **Comparatives/Superlatives** | Comparison skill essential; major Grade 4 feature | **16 stories** (33% of curriculum) |

### Tier 2: Supporting Features (Integrated Throughout)

| Priority | Feature | Include When | Story Allocation |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **#4** | **Time expressions** (past/future) | Essential for tense meaning | Integrated in all past/future stories |
| **#5** | **As...as** structures | Comparative equality | Integrated in comparative stories |
| **#6** | **Quantifiers** (more/less) | Comparative quantity | Integrated in comparative stories |

### Story Distribution Strategy

**Pattern: MIXED/FOCUS Alternation**

**Week Pattern (repeats 8 times, 3 weeks per cycle):**
```
Week 1:  MIXED (past + future + comparatives)
Week 2:  Focus: Past Simple
Week 3:  MIXED (past + future + comparatives)
Week 4:  Focus: Future with Will
Week 5:  MIXED (past + future + comparatives)
Week 6:  Focus: Comparatives
```

**Total Distribution:**
- **Mixed weeks:** 24 stories (50% of curriculum)
- **Past Simple focus:** 8 stories (17% of curriculum)
- **Future with Will focus:** 8 stories (17% of curriculum)
- **Comparatives focus:** 8 stories (17% of curriculum)

**Note:** Focus weeks emphasise ONE grammar point, but Mixed weeks integrate all three. This ensures both focused practice and comprehensive use.

## 6. Seasonal & Cultural Context

### Overview

This section provides seasonal and cultural context for the Grade 4 curriculum. Seasonal references are **OPTIONAL**, not mandatory.

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Good, readable content** — Most important
2. **Engaging, relatable material** — Humour is ideal when appropriate
3. **Seasonal alignment** — Optional; if included, must align to correct month

**For Grade 4:** Stories can be about ANY age-appropriate topic (school, hobbies, family, travel, sports, etc.). Seasonal events are nice extras when they fit naturally, but should never be forced.

**Content Quality Principles:**
- Better to have excellent non-seasonal content than weak seasonal references
- Humour and engagement are more valuable than seasonal accuracy
- Students learn better when content is interesting and relatable
- Seasonal events create memorable context when used naturally, but not required

### Seasonal Alignment Policy (SIMPLIFIED)

**Seasonal Content: OPTIONAL, Not Required**

Stories may include seasonal references, but this is not mandatory:
- **Primary Priority:** Good, readable, engaging content
- **Secondary Priority:** Humour and wit make content memorable
- **Tertiary Priority:** Seasonal alignment (if relevant to topic)

**When Using Seasonal References:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month:
  - Cherry blossoms: March-April (Japan)
  - Christmas: December
  - Halloween: October
  - Setsubun/Tanabata/Obon: Correct months in Japan
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Examples of Acceptable Seasonal References:**
- December story about holiday plans → mentions Christmas or New Year
- April story about school → mentions new school year starting
- June story about weather → mentions rainy season
- October story about parties → mentions Halloween

**Examples of Unforced (Non-Seasonal) Stories:**
- Sports and hobbies (any month)
- Family trips (any month)
- School subjects and clubs (any month)
- Music, movies, and entertainment (any month)

**Humour Integration (IDEAL):**
Where appropriate, include subtle wit or humour:
- Playful situations students recognize (forgot homework, failed tests made funny)
- Relatable family situations
- Funny mishaps during activities
- Avoid sarcasm or cynicism — keep it warm and relevant

### Cultural Awareness Guidelines

#### 1. Age-Appropriate Content

**Grade 4 level topics:**
- School life and education
- Hobbies and interests
- Family and friends
- Travel and experiences
- Sports and activities
- Simple observations about daily life

**What to avoid:**
- Complex political topics
- Advanced economic concepts
- Abstract philosophical discussions
- Topics requiring sophisticated vocabulary

#### 2. International References (Simple, Clear)

**Use simple comparisons:**
- "In Japan, we celebrate New Year on January 1st. In America, they celebrate New Year too."
- "Cherry blossoms bloom in Japan during spring. In England, flowers bloom in spring too."

**Keep it simple:**
- 1-2 sentences about other regions maximum
- Focus on similarities, not complex differences
- Use familiar vocabulary (937-word scope)

#### 3. Avoiding Stereotypes

**What to avoid:**
- ❌ "Japanese people always eat rice"
- ❌ "American children eat hamburgers every day"

**What to use:**
- ✅ "In Japan, many people eat rice with meals."
- ✅ "In America, hamburgers are a popular food."

**Key principle:** Use specific, accurate details rather than broad generalisations.

### Seasonal Vocabulary Integration

**Domain-specific seasonal terms for Grade 4:**

## 7. Writing Guidelines — Sentence Length, Vocabulary, Complexity

### Sentence Length Requirements (TV-Readable)

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Average sentence length** | 12-14 words per sentence | **TV-readable with translations** |
| **Minimum sentence length** | 10 words | Avoid fragmentation |
| **Maximum sentence length** | 20 words | Strict limit for readability |
| **Sentence length variety** | 10-14 word range | Keep natural flow |
| **Questions** | 12-14 words | Same TV-readable limit |

**Critical Constraint:** All sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously. This constraint applies to **all Eiken levels** (5級 through 1级).

**Note:** These targets are for individual sentences (lines 1-10), not total story word count. Each story contains exactly 20 lines.

### Sentence Length Strategy

**How to structure Grade 4 sentences:**

1. **Simple sentences with past/future tenses**
   - "I went to the park yesterday." (7 words)
   - "She will study English tomorrow." (6 words)

2. **Compound sentences with basic conjunctions**
   - "I like summer, but I don't like hot days." (11 words)
   - "He studied hard, and he got a good score." (10 words)

3. **Comparative sentences**
   - "This book is more interesting than that one." (10 words)
   - "She is taller than her brother." (7 words)

4. **Use time expressions appropriately**
   - "Last winter, we visited Hokkaido." (6 words)
   - "Next month, I will join the tennis club." (9 words)

### Sentence Length Consistency Across Months

| Months | Target Length | Strategy |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| 1-3 | 10-12 words | Simple sentences, basic grammar introduced |
| 4-6 | 11-13 words | Compound sentences with conjunctions |
| 7-9 | 12-14 words | Comparative structures, varied sentence types |
| 10-12 | 12-14 words | Maximum variety within TV readable limit |

### Vocabulary Level Requirements

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Total vocabulary scope** | 937 words | From Grade 4 analysis |
| **Average per story** | 60-80 unique words | New + recycled vocabulary |
| **Common topics vocabulary** | School, hobbies, family, sports, travel | Age-appropriate domains |
| **Time vocabulary** | past/future expressions | Critical for Grade 4 |
| **Comparative vocabulary** | adjectives with -er/more | Essential for comparisons |

### Vocabulary Categories by Month

| Months | Topics | Example Domains |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1-3 | Daily life, basic activities | School, home, weather, seasons |
| 4-6 | Personal experiences | Travel, holidays, family events |
| 7-9 | Hobbies and interests | Sports, music, clubs, activities |
| 10-12 | Goals and future plans | Future aspirations, comparisons |

### Tone and Engagement (IDEAL Quality Factors)

**Primary Tone:** Friendly, encouraging, relatable — simple but not childish

**Humour (Ideal to Include Where Appropriate):**
- Use gentle situations students will recognise
- Playful moments in everyday life
- Relatable school or family situations
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, or unkind humor

**Engagement Characteristics:**
- Relatable topics students experience
- Memorable examples that make grammar clear
- Warm, encouraging tone
- Humour should be light and inclusive

**Example Humour Themes (Grade 4 appropriate):**
- Forgetting homework (gently, not shaming)
- Funny mistakes while learning
- Surprising discoveries
- Playful family situations

**When to Use Humour:**
- Opening lines can grab attention
- Examples can be playful
- Conclusions can be encouraging
- **When to avoid:** Serious topics like sadness, disappointment

### Complexity Requirements

#### Clause Structure

| Requirement | Target | Example (TV-readable) |
|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Simple sentences** | 40-50% of all sentences | Single independent clause |
| **Compound sentences** | 30-40% of all sentences | Two independent clauses with 'and/but/or' |
| **Complex sentences** | 10-20% of all sentences | One independent + one dependent clause |
| **Subordinate clause types** | 1-2 types per story | Because, when, if clauses |

**Key Strategy:** Use simple and compound sentences primarily. Introduce complex sentences gradually with familiar subordinate conjunctions.

**Example Transformation:**
- *Before (complex):* "When I went to the park yesterday with my friends who I met at school, we played football until it started to rain." (24 words — too long)
- *After (TV-readable):* "Yesterday, I went to the park. I met my friends at school. We played football together. It started to rain later." (6 + 7 + 5 + 5 words = 4 sentences)

#### Tense Distribution (PAST/FUTURE Focus)

| Requirement | Target per Story (depending on type) |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Mixed stories** | Past simple: 3-4 sentences, Future: 2-3, Comparatives: 2-3 |
| **Focus: Past Simple** | Past simple: 7-8 sentences, Future: 1-2, Comparatives: 0-1 |
| **Focus: Future with Will** | Future with will: 7-8 sentences, Past: 1-2, Comparatives: 0-1 |
| **Focus: Comparatives** | Comparatives: 7-8 sentences, Past: 1-2, Future: 0-1 |

**Time Expression Distribution:**

| Time Type | Examples | Target per Story |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **Past time** | yesterday, last week, last month, ago | 3-5 in past-focused stories |
| **Future time** | tomorrow, next week, next month, soon | 3-5 in future-focused stories |
| **General time** | in summer, on Monday, at 3 o'clock | 2-3 in mixed stories |

#### Comparative Structure Distribution

| Structure Type | Example | Target per Comparative Story |
|----------------|---------|----------------------------|
| **-er adjectives** | bigger, taller, faster | 2-3 instances |
| **more + adjective** | more interesting, more beautiful | 2-3 instances |
| **-est adjectives** | biggest, tallest, fastest | 1-2 instances |
| **most + adjective** | most interesting, most beautiful | 1-2 instances |
| **as...as** | as big as, as tall as | 1-2 instances |
| **not as...as** | not as big as, not as tall as | 1-2 instances |

### Cohesion and Coherence

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| **Sentence connections** | Basic conjunctions (and, but, or, so) |
| **Thematic consistency** | One clear topic per story |
| **Logical flow** | Simple chronological or topic organization |
| **Referential clarity** | Pronouns with clear antecedents (he, she, it, they, we) |

## 9. Story Structure — Format Requirements

### Content Format Requirements

Each story contains 20 lines total:
- **Lines 1-10:** 10 STORY sentences (content about a specific theme) with emoji + English + Japanese
- **Lines 11-20:** 10 DISCUSSION questions (personal opinion prompts) with emoji + English + Japanese

**⚠️ CRITICAL JAPANESE TRANSLATION RULE:**

**ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS**

Lines 1-10 (Story sentences): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)
Lines 11-20 (Questions): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)

**EVERY LINE format:**
```
[Emoji] [English: 12-14 words]
[Japanese translation]
```

**❌ WRONG (missing Japanese on questions):**
```
📚 Did you enjoy your summer vacation?
Q? What did you do last weekend?
```

**✅ CORRECT (Japanese on ALL lines):**
```
📚 Did you enjoy your summer vacation?
夏休みを楽しみましたか？

🎮 What did you do last weekend?
先週の週末に何をしましたか？
```

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

**Story Sentences (Lines 1-10):**
- Content about a specific theme (e.g., school, hobbies, family)
- Each sentence is 12-14 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Sentences form a cohesive narrative about a topic
- Grammar features: Past simple, future with will, comparatives (depending on type)

**Discussion Questions (Lines 11-20):**
- **STAND-ALONE personal discussion questions** anyone can answer from their own knowledge/opinion
- Each question is 12-14 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Questions use **similar grammar/vocabulary** to the story but are about the **THEME**, not the story content
- Questions do NOT require reading the story
- Questions are conversation/discussion prompts for students to give personal opinions

**Example from Grade 4 content:**

**Story Sentences (about summer vacation):**
```
🏖️ Last summer, I went to the beach with my family.
昨年の夏、私は家族と海に行きました。
😊 The weather was very hot and sunny.
天気はとても暑くて晴れていました。
[... 8 more story sentences ...]
```

**Discussion Questions (about the theme - summer activities):**
```
🏖️ Do you like summer or winter better?
夏と冬のどちらが好きですか？

🎨 What did you do during your last summer vacation?
最後の夏休みの間に何をしましたか？

😄 What is your favorite summer activity?
あなたのお気に入りの夏の活動は何ですか？
[... 7 more questions about summer activities ...]
```

**Pattern:** Same format for ALL 20 lines:
```
😊 English sentence OR question (12-14 words).
日本語の翻訳です。
```

**Key Points:**
- Both story sentences AND discussion questions follow the SAME format
- NO empty lines in the story content
- Each story is exactly 20 lines (10 story sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **ALL lines must be 12-14 words** (TV readable constraint)
- Questions are **personal opinion prompts**, NOT reading comprehension tests

### JSON Code Example

```javascript
{
    title: "1. New School Year (Mixed Grammar)",

📚 What subject do you like the most？
あなたはどの科目が一番好きですか？

- **Source file:** `textbook/eiken4.js` (will follow same format as eiken1.js)
- **Note:** Study eiken1.js for format reference when creating Grade 4 content

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Format Violations That Will Result in Rejection

**WRONG FORMAT (do NOT use):**
```javascript
❌ module.exports = [...]
❌ { week: 1, theme: "...", story: "...", grammarFocus: "...", level: "...", tags: [...] }
❌ String concatenation: "Line 1\n" + "Line 2\n" + ...
❌ Single property merging sentences and questions
❌ Story sentences without Japanese translations
❌ Questions WITHOUT Japanese translations (MAJOR ERROR - ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE Japanese)
```

**CORRECT FORMAT (required):**
```javascript
var eiken4aligned = [
  {
    title: "1. Story Title (Grammar Focus)",
    content: `📚 Story sentence 1 (12-14 words).
日本語の翻訳1。

😊 Story sentence 2 (12-14 words).
日本語の翻訳2。

[... 8 more story sentences with Japanese translations ...]

🎓 Question 1 in English (12-14 words)?
日本語の翻訳1？

📚 Question 2 in English (12-14 words)?
日本語の翻訳2？

[... 8 more questions with Japanese translations ...]`
  },
  // ... more stories
];
```

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ Use `var eiken4aligned = [` array format
- ✅ EXACTLY TWO properties per object: `title` and `content`
- ✅ NO other properties: NO week, NO theme, NO grammarFocus, NO level, NO tags
- ✅ Content uses TEMPLATE LITERAL BACKTICKS (` not string concatenation +)
- ✅ **ALL 20 lines with Japanese translations** (one English line, one Japanese line)
- ✅ **Questions MUST have Japanese translations** (Lines 11-20 = questions, each needs Japanese)
- ✅ Grammar distribution based on story type (Mixed, Focus: Past, Focus: Future, Focus: Comparative)
- ✅ NO empty lines within content template literal
- ✅ Lines 1-10: Story sentences
- ✅ Lines 11-20: Discussion questions about THEME (not story comprehension)

- [ ] Sentence connections clear (and, but, or, so)
- [ ] Thematic consistency maintained (one clear topic)
- [ ] Logical flow (chronological or topic-based)
- [ ] Referential links clear (pronouns with antecedents)
- [ ] Friendly, encouraging tone

#### Format Verification

- [ ] All 20 lines have Japanese translations
- [ ] Lines 1-10: Story sentences
- [ ] Lines 11-20: Discussion questions
- [ ] NO empty lines within content
- [ ] Template literal backticks used
- [ ] Only `title` and `content` properties

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Mixing grammar types incorrectly** → Follow exact grammar distribution for each story type
2. **Wrong story type** → Mixed vs. Focus distinction is critical
3. **Missing time expressions** → Past/future stories MUST have 3-5 time expressions
4. **Long sentences** → TV readability constraint: **MAX 14 words average, 20 words maximum**
5. **Missing Japanese on questions** → **ALL 20 LINES must have Japanese translations**
6. **Wrong format** → Use `var eiken4aligned = [` with title and content only
7. **Progression assumption** → All 48 stories at SAME level, no difficulty increase
8. **Complexity too high** → Grade 4 is basic-intermediate, not advanced
9. **Topics too abstract** → Keep topics concrete and relatable (school, hobbies, family)
10. **Forgetting emoji** → Each line must have an emoji (story or question icon)

## Appendix: Content Creation Workflow (Required Process)

### Step 1: Create 48-Story Plan Document (MANDATORY First Step)

**Before generating ANY stories, create:**

`TEXTBOOK-PLAN-EIKEN4.md` — Master planning document with:

- All 48 stories outlined (Weeks 1-48)
- Title and theme for each story
- Story type (Mixed, Focus: Past, Focus: Future, Focus: Comparative)
- Grammar focus by week (alternating pattern)
- Sentence length requirement (12-14 words)
- Japanese translation requirement (ALL 20 lines)
- Time expressions for Past/Future focus stories
- Comparative structures for Comparative focus stories

**NOTE:** All 48 stories are at the SAME Grade 4 difficulty level. Weekly changes provide VARIETY, NOT PROGRESSION.

### Step 2: Generate Content Based on Plan

**After plan is complete:**

1. Worker agent generates stories following the plan
2. Reviewer agent checks stories against plan
3. If approved: Save and continue
4. If rejected: Fix, retry

### Step 3: Quality Review and Approval

**Every story MUST pass:**

- [ ] Plan requirements followed
- [ ] Japanese translations on ALL 20 lines
- [ ] Grammar distribution correct for story type
- [ ] Sentence length: 12-14 words (max 20)
- [ ] Past/Future stories have 3-5 time expressions
- [ ] Comparative stories have required comparative structures
- [ ] No progression (Week 1 = Week 48 difficulty)

### Workflow Summary

```
1. Blueprint (SPEC) ✅ Complete
2. Plan (TEXTBOOK-PLAN) ← FIRST STEP (not done yet)
3. Worker agent → generates stories based on plan
4. Reviewer agent → checks against plan
5. Approval/rejection → proceed or fix
6. Repeat for all 48 stories
```

**Critical Rule:** NEVER generate content without a plan document first. The plan is the single source of truth for what each story must contain.

### NO PROGRESSION Principle (Critical Design)

**All 48 stories are at the SAME Grade 4 difficulty level:**

- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Weekly Changes = Variety Only (NOT Progression):**

- Different story types (Mixed vs. Focus) for variety
- Different topics for variety
- Different grammatical emphasis (Past, Future, or Comparative focus)
- NO "integration phase" or "mastery phase"

This makes infinite content generation possible for a real skill.
