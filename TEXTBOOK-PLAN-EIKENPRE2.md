# Eiken Pre-2 (準2級) — 48-Story Master Plan

**Created:** 23 February 2026  
**Based on:** SPEC-EIKENPRE2-ALIGNED.md Version 1.0  
**Total Stories:** 48 (4 stories/month × 12 months)  
**Curriculum Duration:** 12 months (48 weeks)

---

## 1. Overview

### Curriculum Summary
- **Total stories:** 48 (Weeks 1-48)
- **Format per story:** 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **Sentence length:** 15-18 words average (TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously)
- **ALL lines (1-20):** Emoji + English (15-18 words) + Japanese translation

**⚠️ CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE: NO PROGRESSION**

**All 48 stories are at the SAME 準2級 difficulty level.** No progressive building to "mastery."

**Why No Progression:**
- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Weekly Changes = Variety Only (NOT Progression):**
- 8-week rotating pattern provides variety in modal focus
- Different topics for variety (school, hobbies, travel, technology, etc.)
- **MODAL EXPLOSION:** Every story contains 8-12 modal verbs (minimum 8)
- 1st conditionals introduced from Week 5 onwards (1-3 instances)
- Gerunds/infinitives from Week 7 onwards (2-3 instances)

**Every Single Story (Weeks 1-48) Must Have:**
- Modal verbs: 8-12 instances (STRICT MINIMUM = 8)
- Modal variety: At least 4 different modal types per story
- 1st conditionals: 1-3 instances (Week 5+ only)
- Gerunds/infinitives: 2-3 instances (Week 7+ only)
- Sentence length: 15-18 words (max 22)
- Japanese translations: ALL 20 lines

This makes infinite content generation possible for a real skill — any week can be a student's first or last at 準2級 level.

### Story Structure
**Lines 1-10:** Story sentences (student-friendly content about a theme)  
**Lines 11-20:** Discussion questions (stand-alone personal opinion prompts about the theme)

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE:** ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS

**Format:**
```
😊 English sentence or question (15-18 words).
日本語の翻訳
```

### Pre-2 Profile (From Test Reality)
- **Vocabulary:** 1,862 unique words (+63% from 3級)
- **MODAL EXPLOSION:** 88 modal occurrences — the ENTIRE test feature
- **1st conditionals:** Introduced at 準2級 (new grammatical feature)
- **Gerunds/infinitives:** Expanded complexity
- **Passive voice:** Light preview (5 occurrences) — NOT dominant yet
- **Sentence length:** 15-18 words average (TV-readable)

| **Week 8** | CONDITIONAL FOCUS | **1st Conditionals** (if...will) | Modals in conditions | 3-4 conditionals + 4-6 modals |

## 7. Content Quality Guidelines

### Primary Priority: Good, Readable Content
- **Above all:** Stories should be engaging and well-written  
- **Readability:** 15-18 word sentences ensure TV readability with translations  
- **Student-friendly tone:** Conversational, relatable, accessible to high school/university students  
- **Topic relevance:** School life, hobbies, travel, technology, future plans, everyday situations

### Secondary Priority: Humour and Engagement
**Use humour where appropriate to make content memorable:**

**Appropriate humour themes for 準2級:**
- Exam stress and last-minute studying
- Procrastination and "I'll start tomorrow"
- Cafeteria food mysteries ("Is this really chicken?")
- Group projects where everyone waits until the deadline
- Forgetting homework and creating frantic excuses
- Speaking English nervously in class
- Part-time job awkward moments and strange customers
- Weekend plans that constantly change

**Humour principles:**
- Gentle wit that students will recognise
- Irony about everyday student situations
- Playful commentary students relate to
- Warm, inclusive humour (no mean-spirited content)
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, mocking, or hurtful content

### Tertiary Priority: Seasonal References (OPTIONAL, Not Required)
**Seasonal content is OPTIONAL — do not force it**

**If using seasonal references:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month:
  - New Year: January
  - Cherry blossoms: March-April
  - Golden Week: April-May
  - Golden Week: April-May
  - Halloween: October
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Better non-seasonal than weak seasonal:**
- ✅ Excellent non-seasonal content about study methods  
- ❌ Weak seasonal reference about Christmas in July (forced and confusing)

### Topic Flexibility
**Stories can be about ANY student-appropriate topic:**
- School and study (exams, homework, classroom, clubs)
- Hobbies and interests (sports, music, reading, games)
- Travel and experiences (trips, festivals, cultural events)
- Future and goals (career, university, dreams)
- Daily life and relationships (friends, family, routines)
- Technology and modern life (smartphones, social media)

**Quality principle:** Theme flexibility allows creators to choose topics they can write well about

→ Step 2: Generate 48 stories based on plan
   → Worker agent: Create stories following plan
   → Reviewer agent: Verify against plan checklist
   → If rejected: Fix, retry
   → If approved: Save, continue
→ Step 3: Repeat for all 48 stories (Weeks 1-48)
```

### Critical Rule
**NEVER generate content without a plan document first.**  
This plan (TEXTBOOK-PLAN-EIKENPRE2.md) is the single source of truth for what each story must contain. All content generation must reference this plan.
