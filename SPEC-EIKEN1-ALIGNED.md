# Eiken Grade 1 Level Specification
## Aligned to Test Reality — Not Official Descriptions

**Created:** 23 February 2026  
**Based on:** Analysis of 2025 Eiken exams (第1-3回), 78 PDFs  
**Data sources:** [eiken-synthesis.md](../eiken-resources/eiken-synthesis.md), [QUICK-REFERENCE.md](../eiken-resources/QUICK-REFERENCE.md), [analysis-results.json](../eiken-resources/eiken-analysis-deepseek/analysis-results.json), [comprehensive-grammar-summary.md](../eiken-resources/eiken-analysis/comprehensive-grammar-summary.md)  
**Target:** 48 stories over 12-month curriculum (4 stories/month × 12 months)

## 1. Level Overview — Grade 1 Summary

### Profile
- **Official Description:** Academic and professional English, near-native proficiency
- **Test Reality:** Academic register with emphasis on hedging, stance markers, and nuanced expression
- **Vocabulary Scope:** 5,018 unique words (41% jump from 準1級's 3,610)
- **Sentence Length:** 10-15 words average (TV-readable with translations)
- **Proficiency Level:** University advanced to professional — near-native academic English
- **Critical Constraint:** Sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously

### Critical Transition: 準1級 → 1级
This is the **5th major transition point** in the Eiken progression:

| Metric | 準1級 | 1級 | Change | Significance |
|--------|--------|-----|--------|--------------|
| Vocabulary | 3,610 | 5,018 | +41% | Largest vocabulary expansion at upper levels |
| Sentence length | 10-15 words | 10-15 words | 0% | **TV-readable constraint applies to all levels** |
| Discourse markers | Essential | Foundation | — | Must be mastered from 準1級 |
| **Hedging/stance** | Previewed | **Core skill** | NEW | The missing piece — academic nuance |
| Modals | High usage | **Peak: 143 occurrences** | +15% | Modals plus hedging for tentativeness |
| Passive voice | Moderate | **Peak: 52 occurrences** | +30% | Academic passive in all tenses |

**Note on Sentence Length:** Whilst actual Grade 1 exams use longer sentences (28-35 words), this curriculum uses 10-15 words to ensure TV readability with translations. Grammar complexity is maintained through strategic use of hedging, discourse markers, and passive voice, rather than long embedding.

### What Makes Grade 1 Different

**Unlike previous levels:**
1. **Nuance over certainty** — Academic English is tentative, not declarative
2. **Multiple viewpoints** — Must present balanced arguments, not single perspectives
3. **Technical vocabulary** — Subject-specific terminology (science, economics, policy)
4. **Implicit meaning** — Inference and connotation matter as much as denotation
5. **Register awareness** — Formal academic language distinct from general discourse

## 2. Test Reality Summary — What Eiken Analysis Shows

### The Official Description vs. Test Reality Gap

| Official Description | Test Reality | Impact on Teaching |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Academic and professional situations" | **Hedging and stance markers are the core differentiator** | Teach nuance, not just advanced grammar |
| "Near-native proficiency" | **Academic passive + modals + hedging create nuance** | Stop teaching "advanced grammar" in isolation |
| "Express complex ideas" | **Discipline-specific vocabulary matters most** | Categorise vocab by domain, not difficulty alone |

### Four Pillars of Grade 1 Success

#### 1. Hedging and Stance Markers (CRITICAL — Missing from official description)

**What the data shows:**
- Grade 1 introduces stance markers as a tested feature
- Unlike 準1級 where discourse markers (moreover, however) are key, Grade 1 requires modalised certainty
- Example markers: *arguably, reportedly, purportedly, in my view, from my perspective, ostensibly, apparently*

**Test evidence:**
- 準1級: Discourse markers tested explicitly (moreover, however, nevertheless, consequently)
- 1级: Hedging added to discourse markers — students must combine both

#### 2. Discourse Markers (Foundation must be solid from 準1級)

**Continuing features:**
- Addition: *moreover, furthermore, in addition*
- Contrast: *however, nevertheless, on the other hand, conversely*
- Result: *therefore, consequently, as a result, thus*
- Conclusion: *in conclusion, to summarise, ultimately*

**Grade 1 additions:**
- *Inter alia, vis-à-vis, ipso facto, a priori* (Latin phrases in academic contexts)

#### 3. Academic Passive Voice (Peak usage: 52 occurrences)

**All tenses, all purposes:**
- Present passive for general truths: *"It is argued that..."*
- Past passive for research findings: *"The study was conducted..."*
- Perfect passive for completed actions: *"The data have been analysed..."*
- Future passive for predictions: *"The results will be published..."*

**Purposes in academic texts:**
- Objectivity (removing the agent)
- Focus on process/study over researcher
- Conventional academic formatting

#### 4. Modals Peak (143 occurrences)

**Primary functions:**
- Epistemic modality (degrees of certainty): *may, might, could, would*
- Deontic modality (obligation/advice): *should, ought to, must*
- Hedging functions: *would seem to appear to tend to*

**Critical insight:** Modals alone ≠ hedging. Hedging is modals + stance markers + lexical verbs of probability (*appear, seem, suggest*)

### The Inversion Problem

**Current curriculum gap:**
- Many Grade 1 resources overemphasise inversion (*Seldom do I see...* and *Not only did he...*)
- Inversion occurs infrequently in actual exams
- Students spend disproportionate time on low-yield grammar

**Evidence from analysis:**
- Inversion occurrences in Grade 1: Minimal compared to hedging/passive/discourse
- Teaching priority should reflect: Hedging > Discourse Markers > Academic Passive > Inversion

### Tier 2: High Priority (6-8 stories each)

| Priority | Feature | Why Important | Story Allocation |
|----------|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **#4** | **Modals for hedging** | 143 occurrences — peak usage; must combined with stance markers | **6-8 stories** (13-17% of curriculum) |
| **#5** | **Complex embedding** | Multiple subordinate clauses; 28-35 word sentences | **5-6 stories** (10-13% of curriculum) |
| **#6** | **Nominalisation** | Verbs → nouns; formal academic register | **4-5 stories** (8-10% of curriculum) |

- Example: Story 29 (August) should be about economics/health/education/security

**Fair Rotation Strategy:**
- ALL hedging types available every month (epistemic, attribution, modal-based, complex)
- ALL discourse types available every month (addition, contrast, consequence, conclusion)
- For every 4-story batch: Include 2-3 different hedging types and 2-3 different discourse types
- Avoid repeating the SAME type 4 times in a row

## 6. Seasonal & Cultural Context

### Overview

This section provides seasonal and cultural context for the Grade 1 curriculum. Seasonal references are **OPTIONAL**, not mandatory.

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Good, readable content** — Most important
2. **Engaging, relatable material** — Humour is ideal when appropriate
3. **Seasonal alignment** — Optional; if included, must align to correct month

**For Grade 1**: Stories can be about ANY academic/professional topic (education, policy, climate, AI, economics, research, etc.). Seasonal events are nice extras when they fit naturally, but should never be forced.

**Content Quality Principles:**
- Better to have excellent non-seasonal content than weak seasonal references
- Humour and engagement are more valuable than seasonal accuracy
- Students learn better when content is interesting and relatable
- Seasonal events create memorable context when used naturally, but not required

### Seasonal Alignment Policy (SIMPLIFIED)

**Seasonal Content: OPTIONAL, Not Required**

Stories may include seasonal references, but this is not mandatory:
- **Primary Priority:** Good, readable, engaging content
- **Secondary Priority:** Humour and wit make content memorable
- **Tertiary Priority:** Seasonal alignment (if relevant to topic)

**When Using Seasonal References:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month:
  - Cherry blossoms: March-April (Japan)
  - Christmas: December
  - Halloween: October
  - Setsubun: February
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Examples of Acceptable Seasonal References:**
- December story about year-end policy reviews → mentions annual budgeting cycles
- April story about university admissions → mentions spring semester begins
- June story about environmental research → mentions rainy season data collection
- October story about public health → mentions flu season preparation

**Examples of Unforced (Non-Seasonal) Stories:**
- AI ethics and technology regulation (any month)
- International trade policy analysis (any month)
- Gender equality in academic publishing (any month)
- Healthcare systems comparison (any month)

**Humour Integration (IDEAL):**
Where appropriate, include subtle wit or humour:
- Gentle irony about policy contradictions
- Playful commentary on academic bureaucracy
- Relatable situations that students recognize
- Avoid sarcasm or cynicism — keep it warm and relevant

### Integration to Monthly Progression Schedule

This table connects seasonal events to Grade 1 academic/professional themes for each month (1–12 in the curriculum).

| Month (Curriculum) | Academic Seasonal Theme | Seasonal Event Connections | Grammar Alignment Recommendations |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|

### Cultural Awareness Guidelines

#### 1. Referencing Multiple Regions without Confusion

**Strategic approaches:**
- **Primary context**: Osaka/Japan (students' direct experience) serves as anchor
- **Secondary comparison**: Brief, explicit references to other regions (2–3 sentences max per theme)
- **Comparative language**: Use contrastive discourse markers ("Whilst Japan celebrates..., the UK observes...", "Unlike in Australia where..., in the United States...")
- **Neutral terminology**: Avoid evaluative comparisons; focus on descriptive differences

**Example pattern:**
> "In Japan, the cherry blossom season (sakura) in April traditionally symbolises new beginnings and educational renewal. Whilst England observes Easter and spring holidays during the same period, Australia experiences the onset of autumn with daylight saving time ending. These seasonal variations, though culturally distinct, may arguably reflect different institutional calendars that influence academic scheduling."

#### 2. International Perspectives for Near-Native Grade 1 Students

**Why multiple regions matter for Grade 1:**
- Grade 1 students engage with international academic and professional discourse
- Exposure to diverse cultural contexts broadens academic vocabulary and perspective-taking
- International reference points mirror authentic English-language academic writing (often global in scope)
- Near-native proficiency requires cultural fluency, not just linguistic competence

**Implementation guidelines:**
- **Academic framing**: Present seasonal events as topics for research, policy analysis, or comparative study
- **Authentic sources**: Reference actual international conferences, policy documents, comparative research studies
- **Professional applications**: Connect seasonal events to business cycles, conference attendance, research publication timing
- **Avoid tokenism**: Seasonal references should genuinely support academic discussion, not be decorative

**Example academic framing:**
> "The annual summer conference season, which coincides with school holidays across Japan, the United Kingdom, and North America, has been observed to create distinct patterns in academic publishing. Research suggests that submission rates tend to peak immediately following major international conferences, whilst acceptance decisions are reportedly cluster in autumn months when reviewer availability improves."

#### 3. Avoiding Cultural Stereotypes while Celebrating Diversity

**Principles:**
- **Specificity over generalisation**: Reference specific festivals or policies, not broad "Japanese culture" or "American lifestyle"
- **Authentic representation**: Use accurate details (dates, official names, historical context)
- **Contemporary relevance**: Focus on current practices, not historical or outdated depictions
- **Multiple voices**: Acknowledge diversity within regions (e.g., "Some Australian states observe Labour Day in May, others in October")

**What to avoid:**
- ❌ "Japanese people love cherry blossoms and always have hanami parties"
- ✅ "Sakura season in Japan typically peaks in early April, with many educational institutions holding entrance ceremonies during this period"

- ❌ "Americans celebrate Thanksgiving with big family meals"
- ✅ "Thanksgiving in the United States occurs on the fourth Thursday in November and is often associated with extended family gatherings and a statutory long weekend"

- ❌ "Australia is always hot in summer because it's in the Southern Hemisphere"
- ✅ "December marks the beginning of summer in Australia, with many schools commencing summer holidays and university academic years concluding"

#### 4. Seasonal Relevance by Eiken Level

**Grade 1 vs. Lower Levels (5–3):**

| Level | Seasonal Focus | Example Themes |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Grade 1 (1級)** | Academic/professional seasonal contexts | "International education policy conferences coincide with Northern Hemisphere autumn terms" |
| **準1級 (Pre-1)** | University-level seasonal connections | "University application cycles and research publication timing" |
| **2級 (Grade 2)** | Business/workplace seasonal patterns | "Holiday retail sales analysis, quarterly business reviews" |
| **準2級/準2級プラス** | School-related seasonal life | "School events, holiday studies, part-time work during break periods" |
| **3級 (Grade 3)** | Personal seasonal experiences | "Holiday plans, seasonal activities, school trip descriptions" |
| **4級/5級** | Basic seasonal vocabulary | "It is hot in summer. I like spring." |

**Key distinction:** For Grade 1, seasonal events are not the topic itself but the **context** for academic/professional discussion. Students engage with seasons via research analysis, policy review, or conference discourse—mirroring how educated adults discuss seasonal patterns in professional settings.

### Seasonal Vocabulary Integration

**Domain-specific seasonal terms for Grade 1:**

| Seasonal Category | Academic Vocabulary | Example Context |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Education calendar** | academic term, semester, enrolment period, commencement, graduation cycle, institutional calendar | Curriculum planning, research submission deadlines |
| **Cultural events** | cultural heritage, traditional celebration, commemorative holiday, public observance, national commemoration | Cultural preservation policy, comparative cultural studies |
| **Seasonal economics** | seasonal fluctuation, cyclical pattern, annual variation, quarterly adjustment, fiscal year alignment | Economic forecasting, retail analysis |
| **Conference cycles** | academic conference, symposium, research峰会, publication cycle, peer review timeline | Academic publishing, knowledge dissemination |
| **Weather/climate policy** | precipitation, seasonal rainfall, temperature variation, climate pattern adaptation, extreme weather response | Environmental policy, climate change research |
| **International comparison** | cross-cultural study, comparative analysis, regional variation, institutional difference, policy convergence | International relations, comparative politics |

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce seasonal vocabulary within academic contexts, not as isolated lists. Students should encounter terms in research reports, policy documents, and conference abstracts where seasonal factors are operational or analytical variables.

## 7. Writing Guidelines — Sentence Length, Vocabulary, Complexity

### Sentence Length Requirements (TV-Readable)

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Average sentence length** | 10-15 words per sentence | **TV-readable with translations** |
| **Minimum sentence length** | 8 words | Avoid fragmentation |
| **Maximum sentence length** | 20 words | Strict limit for readability |
| **Sentence length variety** | 8-15 word range | Keep natural flow |
| **Percentage of sentences** (15+ words) | 20-30% | Occasional longer sentences only |

**Critical Constraint:** All sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously. This constraint applies to **all Eiken levels** (5級 through 1级).

**Note:** These targets are for individual sentences (lines 1-10), not total story word count. Each story contains exactly 20 lines.

### Sentence Length Strategy (Maintaining Grammar Complexity)

**How to maintain Grade 1 complexity without long sentences:**

1. **Use short sentences with hedging markers** instead of long embedding
   - *Instead of:* "Research suggests that studies have shown that evidence supports the view that climate change is accelerating." (19 words)
   - *Use:* "Research suggests climate change is accelerating. This evidence is strong." (9 words + 5 words)

2. **Separate clauses into distinct sentences**
   - *Instead of:* "However, whilst the government has proposed reforms, critics argue that insufficient consultation has occurred." (15 words — long for TV)
   - *Use:* "The government has proposed reforms. However, critics argue consultation was insufficient." (8 words + 7 words)

3. **Use discourse markers to connect short sentences**
   - "The data was analysed carefully. Therefore, the findings are reliable." (7 words + 6 words)

4. **Express complex ideas in 2-3 short sentences**
   - Long: "Academic passive voice is used to remove the agent from the sentence whilst maintaining focus on the action." (19 words)
   - Short: "Academic passive voice removes the agent. This maintains focus on the action. It sounds formal." (7 + 7 + 5 words)

### Sentence Length Consistency Across Months

| Months | Target Length | Strategy |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| 1-3 | 10-12 words | Simple sentences, hedging markers introduced |
| 4-6 | 11-13 words | Two-sentence combinations for discourse flow |
| 7-9 | 12-14 words | Discourse markers connecting 2-3 sentences |
| 10-12 | 13-15 words | Maximum complexity within TV readable limit |

### Vocabulary Level Requirements

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Total vocabulary scope** | 5,018 words | From Grade 1 analysis |
| **Average per story** | 75-100 unique words | New + recycled vocabulary |
| **Academic word family inclusion** | 50-60 AWL words/story | AWL = Academic Word List |
| **Technical/domain vocabulary** | 15-20 terms/story | Discipline-specific (science, economics, policy) |
| **Hedging/stance marker density** | 1.5-2 markers/paragraph | Critical for Grade 1 |

### Vocabulary Categories by Month

| Months | Domain Focus | Example Domains |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1-3 | General academia | Research methods, academic conventions |
| 4-6 | Social sciences | Psychology, sociology, education |
| 7-9 | Natural sciences | Biology, environmental science, technology |
| 10-12 | Professional/Policy | Economics, law, international relations |

### Tone and Engagement (IDEAL Quality Factors)

**Primary Tone:** Academic and professional, but engaging and accessible

**Humour (Ideal to Include Where Appropriate):**
- Use gentle wit that students will recognise
- Irony about real academic situations (bureaucracy, reviews, deadlines)
- Playful commentary students relate to (study habits, cafeteria food, group projects)
- **Avoid:** Sarcasm, cynicism, mocking, or mean-spirited content

**Engagement Characteristics:**
- Relatable situations students experience
- Memorable examples that stick
- Balanced tone: professional but not dry, engaging but not silly
- Humour should be light, warm, and inclusive

**Example Humor Themes:**
- Academic bureaucracy delays and absurdities
- Perfect research plans that inevitably change
- Student procrastination and deadline madness
- Group project dynamics (everyone loves group work)
- Conference presentation anxiety
- Reviewer feedback being politely brutal

**When to Use Humour:**
- Opening lines can grab attention
- Examples can be playful
- Conclusions can warm the tone
- **When to avoid:** Serious topics like inequality, discrimination, tragedy

### Complexity Requirements (Adapted for TV-Readable Sentences)

#### Clause Structure

| Requirement | Target | Example (TV-readable) |
|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Complex sentences** (subordinate clauses) | 30-40% of all sentences | Single independent + 1 dependent |
| **Compound sentences** | 30-40% of all sentences | Multiple independent clauses |
| **Simple sentences** | 20-30% of all sentences | Single independent clause |
| **Subordinate clause types** | At least 2 types per story | Relative, adverbial clauses |
| **Embedding depth** | 1-2 levels maximum (all months) | *[Research shows [X is true]]* |

**Key Strategy:** Use 2-3 short sentences with discourse markers instead of 1 long complex sentence with deep embedding.

**Example Transformation:**
- *Before (long):* "The study was conducted over three years, and the data was analysed using advanced statistical methods to determine whether significant correlations existed." (24 words)
- *After (TV-readable):* "The study ran for three years. Researchers analysed the data. They used advanced statistical methods." (14 words total, 3 sentences)

#### Passive Voice Distribution

| Requirement | Target per Story (after Month 3) |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| **Total passive sentences** | 8-12 sentences |
| **Academic passive** (*It is argued that...*) | 2-3 sentences |
| **Process passive** (*The study was conducted...*) | 3-4 sentences |
| **Result passive** (*Data have been analysed...*) | 2-3 sentences |
| **Passive with by-agent** (occasional) | 1-2 sentences |

#### Hedging Distribution (EXACT COUNTS - CRITICAL)

| Requirement | Target per Story |
|-------------|------------------|
| **EXPLICIT stance markers** | 3-6 instances (flexible range) |
| **Discourse markers** | 4-6 instances (STRICT MINIMUM = 4) |
| **Modal hedging** (*may, might, could, would*) | 2-4 instances |
| **Implicit hedging** (*appear, seem, suggest*) | 2-3 instances (optional) |

**Note:** Hedging target is 3-6 (flexible range). Focus on quality and readability over strict counts. The Japanese translation requirement is strict (all 20 lines must have Japanese), but hedging count can be flexible.

**Monthly Hedging Marker Types (STRICT - Do NOT Mix):**

| Month | Weeks | Hedging Type | EXACT Markers to Use | Markers to AVOID |
|-------|-------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **January** | 1-4 | **Epistemic stance ONLY** | arguably, perhaps, ostensibly, apparently, seemingly, likely, presumably | reported, purported, alleged, supposed |
| **February** | 5-8 | **Attribution stance ONLY** | reportedly, purportedly, allegedly, supposedly | arguably, perhaps, ostensibly, apparently |
| **March** | 9-12 | Addition discourse focus | moreover, furthermore, in addition | January/February hedges |
| **April** | 13-16 | Contrast discourse focus | however, nevertheless, on the other hand | Previous discourse types |
| **May** | 17-20 | Academic passive (Present) | It is argued that... | Previous hedges/discourse |
| **June** | 21-24 | Academic passive (Past) | The study was conducted... | Previous hedges/discourse |
| **July** | 25-28 | Modals for hedging | may/might (low probability) | Previous hedges/discourse |
| **August** | 29-32 | Modals for hedging | could/would (theoretical) | Previous hedges/discourse |
| **September** | 33-36 | Integration (hedging + discourse) | Mix of Month 1-4 | — |
| **October** | 37-40 | Integration (passive + modals) | Mix of Month 5-8 | — |
| **November** | 41-44 | Complex embedding (1-2 levels) | Mix of Month 1-10 | — |
| **December** | 45-48 | Full mastery (all features) | ALL 11 months features | — |

#### Discourse Marker Distribution (EXACT COUNTS)

| Requirement | Target per Story |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Total discourse markers** | 4-6 instances (STRICT) |
| **Addition markers** | 1-2 instances (*moreover, furthermore*) |
| **Contrast markers** | 1-2 instances (*however, nevertheless*) |
| **Consequence markers** | 1-2 instances (*therefore, consequently*) |
| **Conclusion markers** | 0-1 instances (*in conclusion*) - optional for stories with questions only |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Discourse markers are separate from hedging markers. Count them separately.

**Hedging markers** = arguably, perhaps, reportedly, purportedly (stance language)
**Discourse markers** = however, moreover, therefore (logical connectors)

These are TWO DIFFERENT GRAMMAR CATEGORIES and must be counted separately.

---

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL: ACADEMIC PASSIVE IS MANDATORY — EVERY STORY MUST HAVE 5-8 PASSIVE SENTENCES ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST COMMON FAILURE MODE**

Despite explicit requirements, agents repeatedly generate stories with ONLY 0-3 passive sentences (need 5-8 MANDATORY).

**Passive Voice Structure:**

**CORRECT Academic Passive:**
- "The study **was conducted** over three years."
- "Research **has been published** in the journal."
- "Data **were analysed** using statistical methods."
- "The theory **is supported** by multiple studies."
- "Results **are being reviewed** by experts."
- "Funding **has been allocated** to the project."

**INCORRECT — Active Voice (Agents incorrectly use this):**
- ❌ "Researchers **conducted** the study." (active voice)
- ❌ "The journal **published** the research." (active voice)
- ❌ "We **analysed** the data." (active voice)
- ❌ "Experts **are reviewing** the results." (present simple active)

---

### EXACT REQUIREMENT: Specific Lines MUST Be Passive

**MANDATORY: Lines 1-5 Are FORCED PASSIVE — No Active Voice Allowed**

**Story Structure (FORCED PASSIVE REQUIREMENT):**

```
Line 1:  MUST BE PASSIVE ("was/were [verb]ed" or "is/are [verb]ed")
Line 2:  MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 3:  MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 4:  MUST BE PASSIVE
Line 5:  MUST BE PASSIVE

Lines 6-10: Can be ACTIVE or PASSIVE (no restriction)
Lines 11-20: Questions — Can be ACTIVE or PASSIVE (no restriction)
```

**Example Story with 5 Forced Passive Sentences (CORRECT):**

```
Line 1: The study was conducted at the university. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
Line 2: Data were collected from multiple sources. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
Line 3: Results have been published in journals. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
Line 4: The theory is supported by evidence. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
Line 5: New methods are being developed. (PASSIVE ✅ MANDATORY)
Line 6: However, researchers continue their work. (ACTIVE ✓ OK)
Line 7: Moreover, funding has been secured. (PASSIVE ✓ OK)
Line 8: Students are learning effectively. (ACTIVE ✓ OK)
Line 9: Policies are being considered. (PASSIVE ✓ OK)
Line 10: Therefore, outcomes are improving. (ACTIVE ✓ OK)
```

**MANDATORY RESULT: Lines 1-5 = 5 PASSIVE (FORCED), Minimum reached ✅**

**Root Cause of Previous Failures:** Language models naturally prefer ACTIVE voice and ignore instructions that say "include 5-8 passive" because active voice feels "more natural." By FORCING Lines 1-5 to be passive, natural tendencies are overridden and the requirement becomes impossible to fail.

---

### How to Construct Academic Passive Sentences

**Use These Patterns:**

1. **Past Passive:** "was/were [verb]ed"
   - "The study **was designed** carefully."
   - "Data **were collected** from participants."
   - "Experiments **were conducted** in a lab."

2. **Present Passive:** "is/are [verb]ed" or "is/are being [verb]ed"
   - "The approach **is based** on previous work."
   - "Findings **are being discussed** widely."
   - "Methods **are being refined** continuously."

3. **Perfect Passive:** "has/have been [verb]ed"
   - "Research **has been published** in journals."
   - "Funding **has been allocated** to the project."
   - "The paper **has been reviewed** by experts."

---

### MANDATORY Checklist for Every Story

**Before finalizing a story, verify:**

- [ ] Count passive sentences in Lines 1-10 (story sentences)
- [ ] If count < 5: ADD MORE PASSIVE SENTENCES
- [ ] If count > 8: REMOVE SOME PASSIVE SENTENCES
- [ ] Questions (Lines 11-20): Can be active voice (no requirement)

**Passive Sentence Construction:**
- Look for: "is/are/was/were + [verb]ed" or "has/have been + [verb]ed" or "is/are being + [verb]ed"
- Each passive sentence counts toward the 5-8 requirement
- You MUST have EXACTLY 5-8 passive sentences in Lines 1-10

---

### Common Mistakes to AVOID

**❌ MISTAKE 1: Using active voice instead of passive**
- Wrong: "Researchers conducted the study."
- Correct: "The study was conducted by researchers." or "The study was conducted."

**❌ MISTAKE 2: Using "are" without "ed" (present simple active)**
- Wrong: "Experts are reviewing the results."
- Correct: "Results are being reviewed by experts." or "Results have been reviewed."

**❌ MISTAKE 3: Using "is being" with adjective instead of passive**
- Wrong: "The study is being important." (this is active, not passive)
- Correct: "The study is being conducted." (passive)
- Correct: "The findings are being discussed." (passive)

**✅ CORRECT: Use "is/are/was/were + [verb]ed"**
- "is/are + [verb]ed" = Present passive
- "was/were + [verb]ed" = Past passive
- "has/have been + [verb]ed" = Perfect passive
- "is/are being + [verb]ed" = Passive continuous

---

### MANDATORY: Verify Before Output

For EVERY story, before final output:
1. Count passive sentences in Lines 1-10
2. If count is 0-3: **REJECT AND FIX** - Add 2-5 more passive sentences
3. If count is 5-8: **PROCEED** - Correct
4. If count is 9+: **REDUCE** - Remove excess passive sentences

**This is NOT optional. It is MANDATORY.**

---

### Cohesion and Coherence

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| **Paragraph transitions** | Explicit discourse markers in first/last sentences |
| **Thematic consistency** | One academic topic per story |
| **Logical flow** | Argument structure (claim → evidence → qualification) |
| **Referential clarity** | Pronouns with clear antecedents; nominal reference for abstraction |

---

**ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS**

Lines 1-10 (Story sentences): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)
Lines 11-20 (Questions): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)

**EVERY LINE format:**
```
[Emoji] [English: 10-15 words]
[Japanese translation]
```

**❌ WRONG (missing Japanese on questions):**
```
🎓 Should educational reform be prioritised in your community?
Q? Does technology help or hinder learning?
```

**✅ CORRECT (Japanese on ALL lines):**
```
🎓 Should educational reform be prioritised in your community?
あなたのコミュニティで教育改革を優先すべきですか？

📚 Does technology help or hinder learning in your experience?
あなたの経験では技術は学習を助けますか、それとも妨げますか？
```

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

**Story Sentences (Lines 1-10):**
- Academic/professional content about a specific theme (e.g., educational reform, AI ethics, climate policy)
- Each sentence is 10-15 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Sentences form a cohesive narrative about an academic topic
- Grammar features: hedging markers, discourse markers, academic passive, modals

**Discussion Questions (Lines 11-20):**
- **STAND-ALONE personal discussion questions** anyone can answer from their own knowledge/opinion
- Each question is 10-15 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Questions use **similar grammar/vocabulary** to the story but are about the **THEME**, not the story content
- Questions do NOT require reading the story
- Questions are conversation/discussion prompts for students to give personal opinions

**Example from existing Eiken 1 content (Corporate Merger story):**

**Story Sentences (about business mergers):**
```
💼 The conglomerate announced a lucrative merger to consolidate its market dominance.
その複合企業は、市場支配力を強化するために収益性の高い合併を発表しました。
📈 Analysts predicted that the acquisition would mitigate the risk of bankruptcy.
アナリストは、この買収が破産のリスクを軽減すると予測しました。
[... 8 more story sentences ...]
```

**Discussion Questions (about the theme - mergers and competition):**
```
💼 Is monopolization a genuine threat to free market capitalism?
独占化は自由市場資本主義にとって真の脅威ですか？
📈 Should governments intervene to prevent hostile takeovers?
政府は敵対的買収を防ぐために介入すべきですか？
😄 How does corporate culture impact the success of a merger?
企業文化は合併の成功にどのように影響しますか？
[... 7 more questions about mergers, ethics, capitalism ...]
```

**Pattern:** Same format for ALL 20 lines:
```
😊 English sentence OR question (10-15 words).
日本語の翻訳です。
```

**Key Points:**
- Both story sentences AND discussion questions follow the SAME format
- NO empty lines in the story content
- Each story is exactly 20 lines (10 story sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **ALL lines must be 10-15 words** (TV readable constraint)
- Questions are **personal opinion prompts**, NOT reading comprehension tests

### JSON Code Example

```javascript
{
    title: "1. Educational Reform (Hedging + Discourse Markers)",
    content: `📚 Arguably, educational reforms may affect student motivation significantly.
教育改革は学生の動機付けに重要な影響を与える可能性があります。

😊 New policies reportedly improve academic performance in Japan.
新しい政策は日本の学業成績を向上させる可能性があります。

😊 Studies apparently show consistent learning benefits in winter.
研究は冬に一貫した学習上のメリットがあることを明らかにしています。

🎓 Does competition always lead to better academic outcomes?
競争は常に良い教育結果をもたらしますか？

📚 Should governments control school curricula more strictly?
政府は学校のカリキュラムをより厳しく管理すべきですか？

🌍 How does school size affect student wellbeing?
学校の規模は学生の幸福にどのように影響しますか？`
}
```

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Format Violations That Will Result in Rejection

**WRONG FORMAT (do NOT use):**
```javascript
❌ module.exports = [...]
❌ { week: 1, theme: "...", story: "...", grammarFocus: "...", level: "...", tags: [...] }
❌ String concatenation: "Line 1\n" + "Line 2\n" + ...
❌ Single property merging sentences and questions
❌ Story sentences without Japanese translations
❌ Questions WITHOUT Japanese translations (MAJOR ERROR - ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE Japanese)
```

**CORRECT FORMAT (required):**
```javascript
var eiken1aligned = [
  {
    title: "1. Story Title (Grammar Focus)",
    content: `📚 Story sentence 1 (10-15 words).
日本語の翻訳1。

😊 Story sentence 2 (10-15 words).
日本語の翻訳2。

[... 8 more story sentences with Japanese translations ...]

🎓 Question 1 in English (10-15 words)?
日本語の翻訳1？

📚 Question 2 in English (10-15 words)?
日本語の翻訳2？

[... 8 more questions with Japanese translations ...]`
  },
  // ... more stories
];
```

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ Use `var eiken1aligned = [` array format
- ✅ EXACTLY TWO properties per object: `title` and `content`
- ✅ NO other properties: NO week, NO theme, NO grammarFocus, NO level, NO tags
- ✅ Content uses TEMPLATE LITERAL BACKTICKS (` not string concatenation +)
- ✅ **ALL 20 lines with Japanese translations** (one English line, one Japanese line)
- ✅ **Questions MUST have Japanese translations** (Lines 11-20 = questions, each needs Japanese)
- ✅ **Hedging markers:** 3-6 instances (flexible range, focus on quality over strict count)
- ✅ **Minimum 4 discourse markers** per story (do NOT use fewer than 4)
- ✅ NO empty lines within content template literal
- ✅ Lines 1-10: Story sentences
- ✅ Lines 11-20: Discussion questions about THEME (not story comprehension)

### Monthly-Specific Requirements

#### Months 1-3: Foundation

**Additional requirements:**
- Introduce 2-3 hedging markers per story (explicit focus)
- Introduce 2 discourse markers per story (explicit focus)
- Include at least 4 academic passive sentences per story
- Sentence length: 10-12 words average (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Explicit teaching points highlighted

#### Months 4-6: Building

**Additional requirements:**
- Combine hedging types (epistemic + attribution + probability)
- Combine discourse marker types within single paragraphs
- Include modals for hedging alongside stance markers
- Sentence length: 11-13 words average (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Implicit teaching (features present, less explicit)

#### Months 7-9: Integration

**Additional requirements:**
- All hedging types present (including personal stance)
- Implicit hedging (*appear, seem, suggest*) alongside explicit markers
- Nominalisation (2-3 verb→noun conversions per story)
- Sentence length: 12-14 words average (**TV-readable constraint**)
- High coherence required (explicit + implicit discourse)

#### Months 10-12: Mastery

**Additional requirements:**
- All features integrated seamlessly (no "teaching points")
- Use 2-3 short sentences with discourse markers instead of deep embedding
- Cleft sentences (*It is X that...*) for emphasis
- Implicit discourse flow (semantic coherence without markers)
- Sentence length: 13-15 words average (**TV-readable constraint**)
- Full academic register

### Quality Control Checklist

Before finalizing any stor y, verify:

#### Grammar Verification

- [ ] Hedging/stance markers correctly used (not just modals)
- [ ] Discourse markers appropriate to logical flow
- [ ] Academic passive includes agent omission (true passive)
- [ ] Modals used for hedging, not obligation/advice
- [ ] Embedding depth appropriate to month level
- [ ] Clause variety (relative, adverbial, noun clauses)

#### Vocabulary Verification

- [ ] Vocabulary matches Grade 1 level (5,018-word scope)
- [ ] AWL words present and correctly used
- [ ] Domain terminology accurate to theme
- [ ] No Grade 1 vocabulary gap (too basic)
- [ ] No Grade 1 vocabulary overload (too advanced)

#### Coherence Verification

- [ ] Paragraph transitions clear
- [ ] Argument structure logical (claim-evidence-qualification)
- [ ] Thematic consistency maintained
- [ ] Referential links clear (pronouns, nominal reference)
- [ ] Academic tone appropriate (formal, objective)

#### Length Verification

- [ ] Average sentence length 10-15 words (**TV-readable constraint**)
- [ ] No sentence exceeds 20 words maximum
- [ ] Story contains exactly 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 questions)
- [ ] Word count 75-100 unique vocabulary

#### Exam Alignment Verification

- [ ] Hedging > Inversion (inversion minimal or absent)
- [ ] Academic passive emphasized (matches 52 occurrence data)
- [ ] Discourse markers foundational (from 準1級)
- [ ] Modals for hedging (not just general modals)
- [ ] Academic/professional topics (not everyday conversation)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overemphasis on inversion** → Inversion is 1-2 stories max, not core feature
2. **Underemphasis on hedging** → Hedging is 12-15 stories, the #1 priority
3. **Everyday conversation topics** → Grade 1 requires academic/professional themes
4. **Long sentences** → TV readability constraint: **MAX 15 words average, 20 words maximum**
5. **Explicit instruction in later months** → Months 10-12 should be seamless, no teaching points
6. **Missing discourse markers** → Discourse markers are 10-12 stories, still critical
7. **Academic passive underuse** → 8-10 stories required, peak usage at Grade 1
8. **Modals without hedging** → Modals at Grade 1 must function hedging, not deontic
9. **Deep embedding** → Use 2-3 short sentences with discourse markers instead (TV readability)

## Appendix B: Sentence Structure Examples by Level (TV-Readable)

### Grade 1 Sample Sentences (10-15 words)

**Example 1: Hedging + Discourse + Passive**
*"However, government responses have been argued insufficient. Reports suggest significant damage."* (13 words total, 2 sentences)

**Example 2: Hedging + Discourse (no deep embedding)**
*"Research studies suggest the policy may fail. Stakeholders need information."* (11 words total, 2 sentences)

**Example 3: Nominalisation + Hedging + Discourse**
*"Moreover, economic benefits could potentially result. Analysts report concerns."* (10 words total, 2 sentences)

**Example 4: Academic Passive + Hedging (split across sentences)**
*"Studies should examine social mobility patterns. Other factors may be responsible."* (11 words total, 2 sentences)

---

**Note:** These examples maintain Grade 1 grammar complexity (hedging, discourse markers, passive, nominalisation) but use 2-3 short sentences instead of 1 long sentence, ensuring TV readability with translations.

| | | THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST COMMON FAILURE MODE — section added to prevent this |
| 23 Feb 2026 | 2.9 | **CRITICAL: FORCED PASSIVE FOR LINES 1-5 — FIX FOR RECURRING FAILURE** |
| | | **Root cause diagnostic:** Language models naturally prefer ACTIVE voice (training data tendency) |
| | | Instructions like "include 5-8 passive" are ignored because active feels "natural" to agents |
| | | **Fix:** FORCE Lines 1-5 to be PASSIVE — "MUST BE PASSIVE" (no choice) |
| | | Changed requirement from: "include 5-8 passive sentences" → "Lines 1-5 MUST BE PASSIVE" |
| | | Lines 6-10: Can be active or passive (no restriction) |
| | | This overrides natural tendencies because specific lines are FORCED to use passive voice |
| | | Example shows Lines 1-5 all passive (FORCED), Lines 6-10 flexible |
| | | Applied to SPEC-EIKEN1-ALIGNED.md and TEXTBOOK-PLAN-EIKEN1.md |
| | | This makes the requirement IMPOSSIBLE to fail (forced pattern overrides natural tendencies) |
| | | Sub-agent verification recommended before_RETRY |

**End of Specification Document**

## Appendix: Content Creation Workflow (Required Process)

### Step 1: Create 48-Story Plan Document (MANDATORY First Step)

**Before generating ANY stories, create:**

`TEXTBOOK-PLAN-EIKEN1.md` — Master planning document with:

- All 48 stories outlined (Weeks 1-48)
- Title and theme for each story
- Grammar focus by month (variety, NOT progression)
- Discourse type by month (variety, NOT progression)
- Hedging markers to use by month
- Academic passive requirement (5-8 sentences)
- Sentence length requirement (10-15 words)
- Japanese translation requirement (ALL 20 lines)

**NOTE:** All 48 stories are at the SAME difficulty level. Monthly changes provide VARIETY, NOT PROGRESSION.

### Step 2: Generate Content Based on Plan

**After plan is complete:**

1. Worker agent generates stories following the plan
2. Reviewer agent checks stories against plan
3. If approved: Save and continue
4. If rejected: Fix, retry

### Step 3: Quality Review and Approval

**Every story MUST pass:**

- [ ] Plan requirements followed
- [ ] Japanese translations on ALL 20 lines
- [ ] Grammar within specified ranges
- [ ] Hedging: 3-6 instances (flexible)
- [ ] Discourse markers: 4-6 instances
- [ ] Academic passive: 5-8 sentences (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Sentence length: 10-15 words (max 20)

### Workflow Summary

```
1. Blueprint (SPEC) ✅ Complete
2. Plan (TEXTBOOK-PLAN) ✅ Complete ← FIRST STEP
3. Worker agent → generates stories based on plan
4. Reviewer agent → checks against plan
5. Approval/rejection → proceed or fix
6. Repeat for all 48 stories
```

**Critical Rule:** NEVER generate content without a plan document first. The plan is the single source of truth for what each story must contain.

### NO PROGRESSION Principle (Critical Design)

**All 48 stories are at the SAME Grade 1 difficulty level:**

- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Monthly Changes = Variety Only (NOT Progression):**

- Different discourse types for variety
- Different hedging combinations for variety
- Different topics for variety
- NO "integration phase" or "mastery phase"

This makes infinite content generation possible for a real skill.
