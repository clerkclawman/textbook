## 1. Level Overview — Pre-2 (準2級) Summary

### Profile
- **Official Description:** Bridge levels between secondary and advanced English—application skills
- **Test Reality:** **MODAL EXPLOSION** — 88 occurrences make modals the entire test
- **Vocabulary Scope:** 1,862 unique words (63% increase from 3級's 1,156)
- **Sentence Length:** 15-18 words average (suitable for study materials)
- **Proficiency Level:** Upper secondary to early university intermediate — practical English for tests and communication
- **Critical Constraint:** Sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously

### Critical Transition: 3級 → 準2級

This is the **2nd major transition point** in the Eiken progression:

| Metric | 3級 | 準2級 | Change | Significance |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------------|
| Vocabulary | 1,156 | 1,862 | +63% | **Second-largest vocabulary expansion** |
| Modals tested | Low usage | **88 occurrences** | **EXPLOSION** | MODALS → THE TEST |
| 1st conditionals | None | Introduced | NEW | Conditional logic emerges |
| Gerunds/infinitives | Basic | Expanded | +40% | More complex verb patterns |
| Passive voice | Minimal (2) | Light (5) | +150% | Passive preview (NOT dominant yet) |
| Sentence complexity | Moderate | Increased | +0.5 words | Longer, more varied structures |

**Note on Sentence Length:** 15-18 words aligns with study materials and TV readability. The focus is on clarity and modal usage, not overly long sentences.

### What Makes Pre-2 Different

**Unlike previous levels:**
1. **Modals dominate EVERYTHING** — Can, could, should, must, would, might appear constantly
2. **Conditional logic emerges** — First time students see "If...will" structures tested
3. **Vocabulary expands dramatically** — +706 new words in one level jump
4. **Sentence length increases** — From 3級's ~14 words to 15-18 words
5. **Gerund/infinitive complexity** — Multiple verb patterns in single sentences

**Official vs. Test Reality Gap:**
- **Official:** "Bridge levels", "application of English" — vague and misleading
- **Test Reality:** **Modals are the ENTIRE test.** If students don't master can/could/should/must/would/might, they cannot pass.

## 2. Test Reality Summary — What Eiken Analysis Shows

### The Official Description vs. Test Reality Gap

| Official Description | Test Reality | Impact on Teaching |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Bridge levels between secondary and advanced" | **Modals explode (88 occurrences)** | Teach modals FIRST, treat as the core skill |
| "Application skills in everyday situations" | **Modal usage = exam success** | If you fail modals, you fail Pre-2 |
| "Intermediate level grammar" | **Conditional thinking required** | 1st conditionals are new and tested |
| "1,800+ words" | **Vocabulary expansion is real** | +706 words new from 3級 |

### Four Pillars of Pre-2 Success

#### 1. MODAL VERBS — THE Critical Feature (88 Occurrences)

**What the data shows:**
- Modals surge from minimal at 3級 to **dominant at 準2級** (88 total occurrences)
- This is the LARGEST single-grammar-feature jump in the entire Eiken progression
- The modal explosion represents the single most tested grammatical aspect at this level

**Modals tested extensively:**
- **Ability/possibility:** can, could, be able to
- **Necessity/obligation:** must, have to, should
- **Advice/recommendation:** should, ought to, had better
- **Possibility/probability:** may, might, could
- **Future in the past:** would

**Test evidence:**
- 3級: Modals appear occasionally (low priority)
- 準2級: **Modals are EVERYWHERE** (88 occurrences—in reading, listening, writing)
- The "bridge" description is misleading—this is a **modal mastery checkpoint**

#### 2. First Conditionals (Conditional Thinking)

**New feature at 準2級:**
- Structure: *If + present simple, will + verb*
- Purpose: Predict likely outcomes, express logical consequences
- Test focus: Understanding condition-result relationships

**Example patterns:**
- *If it rains tomorrow, we will stay inside.*
- *If you study hard, you will pass the exam.*
- *If she arrives late, she will miss the meeting.*

#### 3. Gerunds and Infinitives (Verb Complexity)

**Expanded usage:**
- Gerunds after verbs: *enjoy reading, avoid studying, practice speaking*
- Infinitives after verbs: *want to go, need to study, decide to leave*
- Both verbs accept gerunds OR infinitives: *start/begin/continue doing/to do*

**This creates complex sentence patterns:**

#### 4. Passive Voice (Preview, NOT Dominant)

**Note:** Passive voice **explodes** at 準2級プラス (+300% jump: 5 → 20 occurrences).
- **準2級:** 5 occurrences (light usage, preview only)
- **準2級プラス:** 20 occurrences (explosion—core feature)

**At 準2級 level:**
- Basic present/past passive understanding expected
- NOT a primary focus (unlike modals or 1st conditionals)
- Prepare students for the upcoming jump at 準2級プラス

## 3. Grammar Priorities — Ranked by Test Reality

### Tier 1: Non-Negotiable (Modal Mastery)

| Priority | Feature | Why Critical | Story Allocation |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **#1** | **MODAL VERBS** — Can/Could | Most basic modal pair; ability vs. past ability | **12-15 stories** (25-31%) |
| **#2** | **MODAL VERBS** — Should/Must | Obligation, necessity, advice | **12-15 stories** (25-31%) |
| **#3** | **MODAL VERBS** — Would/Might | Future in the past, possibility | **8-10 stories** (17-21%) |
| **#4** | **1st Conditionals** | New feature at 準2級; conditional thinking | **6-8 stories** (13-17%) |

### Tier 2: High Priority (Supporting Features)

| Priority | Feature | Why Important | Story Allocation |
|----------|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **#5** | **Gerunds** (-ing forms) | Verb + gerund patterns | **4-5 stories** (8-10%) |
| **#6** | **Infinitives** (to + verb) | Verb + infinitive patterns | **4-5 stories** (8-10%) |
| **#7** | **Comparatives/Superlatives** | Expand expression (review from 4級 with new vocab) | **2-3 stories** (4-6%) |

### Tier 3: Supporting Features

| Priority | Feature | Include When | Story Allocation |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **#8** | **Present perfect** | Review from 3級 with emphasis | **2-3 stories** (4-6%) |
| **#9** | **Basic passive voice** | Preview for 準2級プlas explosion | **1-2 stories** (2-4%) |
| **#10** | **Relative clauses** | Defining who/which/that | **1-2 stories** (2-4%) |

**MODAL DOMINANCE IS UNAVOIDABLE:**
- Even in stories listed for "other features" (gerunds, conditionals, etc.), modal verbs should still appear 3-5 times per story.
- Modals are the DNA of Pre-2 tests—it is impossible to write natural Pre-2 English without modals.

## 5. Weekly Pattern — Modal Dominance with Alternating Focus

### Core Pattern (Modals Focus Weeks)

**The 8-week rotating pattern:**

| Week | Type | Grammar Focus | Modals Emphasised | Notes |
|------|------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Week 1** | MIXED | All modal types (light touch) | All 6 modals | Gentle introduction |
| **Week 2** | MODAL FOCUS | **Can/Could** (ability, possibility) | can, could, can't, couldn't | Primary focus week |
| **Week 3** | MIXED | All modal types (mixed practice) | All 6 modals | Reinforcement |
| **Week 4** | MODAL FOCUS | **Should/Must** (obligation, advice) | should, must, shouldn't, mustn't | Primary focus week |
| **Week 5** | MIXED | All modal types + 1st conditionals | All 6 modals + if...will | Conditionals introduced |
| **Week 6** | MODAL FOCUS | **Would/Might** (past future, possibility) | would, might, wouldn't | Primary focus week |
| **Week 7** | MIXED | All modal types + gerunds/infinitives | All 6 modals + -ing/to | verb patterns expand |
| **Week 8** | CONDITIONAL FOCUS | **1st Conditionals** (if...will) | if...will, unless, when | Conditionals mastery |

**Pattern rotates:** After Week 8, return to Week 1 and repeat with new themes/vocabulary.

### Why This Pattern Works

**Addressing the "Modal Explosion" reality:**
- Each week contains modals (minimum 8-12 modal uses per story)
- Focus weeks (2, 4, 6) intensify specific modal pairs
- Mixed weeks (1, 3, 5, 7) provide variety and cross-modal practice

**Building progressively:**
- **Weeks 1-2:** Can/Could foundation (simplest modal pair)
- **Weeks 3-4:** Should/Must (obligation/necessity)
- **Weeks 5-6:** Would/Might (more abstract)
- **Weeks 7-8:** Conditionals mastery (new feature)

### Monthly Breakdown (4 Weeks per Month → 6 Cycles)

Each month = 1 full 8-week cycle across the 12-month curriculum. After 12 months, the pattern rotates 6 times:

| Months | Weeks | Cycle | Primary Focus in Month |
|--------|-------|-------|------------------------|
| **January** | 1-4 | Weeks 1-4 | Can/Could + Should/Must |
| **February** | 5-8 | Weeks 5-8 | Would/Might + Conditionals |
| **March** | 9-12 | Weeks 1-4 | Can/Could + Should/Must |
| **April** | 13-16 | Weeks 5-8 | Would/Might + Conditionals |
| **May** | 17-20 | Weeks 1-4 | Can/Could + Should/Must |
| **June** | 21-24 | Weeks 5-8 | Would/Might + Conditionals |
| **July** | 25-28 | Weeks 1-4 | Can/Could + Should/Must |
| **August** | 29-32 | Weeks 5-8 | Would/Might + Conditionals |
| **September** | 33-36 | Weeks 1-4 | Can/Could + Should/Must |
| **October** | 37-40 | Weeks 5-8 | Would/Might + Conditionals |
| **November** | 41-44 | Weeks 1-4 | Can/Could + Should/Must |
| **December** | 45-48 | Weeks 5-8 | Would/Might + Conditionals |

### Detailed Weekly Breakdown

#### Weeks 1 and 3: MIXED (All Modal Types)

**Grammar focus:**
- Light practice of all 6 modals: can, could, should, must, would, might
- Balanced distribution (2 of each modal type per story)

**Modal distribution goal:**
- **Can:** 1-2 uses
- **Could:** 1-2 uses
- **Should:** 1-2 uses
- **Must:** 1-2 uses

#### Weeks 2, 4, 6: MODAL FOCUS (Specific Modal Pair)

**Week 2 Focus: Can/Could**
- **Primary:** 4-6 uses of can/could per story
- **Secondary:** Light use of other modals (1-2 each)
- **Function:** Ability, permission, possibility, polite requests

**Week 4 Focus: Should/Must**
- **Primary:** 4-6 uses of should/must per story

#### Weeks 5 and 7: MIXED + Additional Features

**Week 5: Mix + 1st Conditionals**
- All 6 modals (balanced)
- **Plus:** 1-2 first conditional sentences
- Conditional patterns: *If + present, will + verb*

**Week 7: Mix + Gerunds/Infinitives**
- All 6 modals (balanced)
- **Plus:** 2-3 gerund/infinitive verb patterns
- Patterns: *enjoy doing, want to do, start doing/to do*

#### Week 8: CONDITIONAL FOCUS

**Primary focus:** 1st Conditionals
- **3-4 conditional sentences per story**
- Patterns:
  - *If you study hard, you will pass.* (standard)
  - *Unless you study, you will fail.* (negative)
  - *When I finish, I will go.* (certainty)

**Secondary:** Modals supporting conditionals
- *If you **can**, you **should** go.* (modal + conditional)
- *If it **might** rain, we **must** stay inside.* (modals in conditional)

### Story Allocation by Week Pattern

| Week Type | Stories (total 48) | Percentage |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7** (MIXED) | 24 stories | 50% |
| **Week 2** (Can/Could Focus) | 6 stories | 12.5% |
| **Week 4** (Should/Must Focus) | 6 stories | 12.5% |
| **Week 6** (Would/Might Focus) | 6 stories | 12.5% |
| **Week 8** (Conditional Focus) | 6 stories | 12.5% |
| **Total** | **48 stories** | **100%** |

**Verification:** Each month (4 weeks) contains:
- 2 MIXED weeks
- 1 MODAL FOCUS week (varies by month)
- 1 CONDITIONAL FOCUS week (only in even months: Feb, Apr, Jun, Aug, Oct, Dec)

This ensures balanced exposure to all modal types while providing focused practice on each major pair.

## 6. Seasonal & Cultural Context

### Overview

This section provides seasonal and cultural context for the Pre-2 (準2級) curriculum. Seasonal references are **OPTIONAL**, not mandatory.

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Good, readable content** — Most important
2. **Engaging, relatable material** — Humour is ideal when appropriate
3. **Seasonal alignment** — Optional; if included, must align to correct month

**For Pre-2:** Stories can be about **school life, hobbies, travel, technology, social issues, personal goals, part-time work, and everyday experiences**. These topics feel natural to high school/university students preparing for Eiken tests.

**Content Quality Principles:**
- Better to have excellent non-seasonal content than weak seasonal references
- Humour and engagement are more valuable than seasonal accuracy
- Students learn better when content is interesting and relatable
- Seasonal events create memorable context when used naturally, but not required

### Seasonal Alignment Policy (SIMPLIFIED)

**Seasonal Content: OPTIONAL, Not Required**

Stories may include seasonal references, but this is not mandatory:
- **Primary Priority:** Good, readable, engaging content
- **Secondary Priority:** Humour and wit make content memorable
- **Tertiary Priority:** Seasonal alignment (if relevant to topic)

**When Using Seasonal References:**
- Mention seasonal events only when they naturally relate to the topic
- Ensure seasonal events appear in their correct month
- Don't force seasonal connections that feel artificial

**Examples of Acceptable Seasonal References:**
- January story about New Year's resolutions → mentions "starting fresh"
- April story about school entrance ceremonies → mentions "new school year"
- August story about summer activities → mentions "summer holidays" or "vacation"
- December story about year-end plans → mentions "holiday season" or "end of year"

**Examples of Unforced (Non-Seasonal) Stories:**
- Learning English vocabulary and study methods (any month)
- Part-time job experiences and workplace communication (any month)
- Travel plans and cultural experiences (any month)
- Technology and social media use (any month)

**Humour Integration (IDEAL):**
Where appropriate, include subtle wit or humour:
- Relatable student situations (exam stress, procrastination, cafeteria food)
- Everyday mishaps (missing the bus, forgetting homework, awkward moments)
- Playful observations about school life
- Avoid sarcasm or cynicism — keep it warm and relevant

### Cultural Awareness Guidelines

#### 1. Referencing Multiple Regions without Confusion

**Strategic approaches:**
- **Primary context:** Japan (students' direct experience) serves as anchor
- **Secondary comparison:** Brief, explicit references to other regions are optional
- Comparisons should be natural, not forced

**Example pattern (optional, not required):**
> "In Japan, we enjoy cherry blossom viewing in April. In England, people celebrate Easter during spring. Both seasons bring beautiful weather and outdoor activities."

#### 2. Student-Friendly Topics for Pre-2 Level

**Why these topics work for Pre-2:**
- Pre-2 students are typically in high school or early university
- Topics should feel relevant to their life experiences
- Modal verbs naturally fit advice-giving and possibility discussions
- Topics can be about school, hobbies, future plans, everyday situations

**Ideal Pre-2 Topics:**
- **Education:** Exams, study methods, classroom experiences, teachers and classmates
- **Future plans:** Career goals, university choices, dreams and aspirations
- **Hobbies:** Sports, music, art, reading, video games
- **Travel:** Domestic travel, study abroad, cultural experiences
- **Technology:** Social media, smartphones, online learning
- **Social life:** Friends, family, celebrations, part-time work
- **Health and lifestyle:** Exercise, food, healthy habits, stress management

#### 3. Humour and Engagement (IDEAL to Include)

**Principles for Pre-2 humour:**
- Keep it light and relatable
- Focus on common student experiences
- Gentle irony about everyday situations
- Warm, inclusive humour (no mean-spirited content)

**Example humor themes:**
- Exam stress and procrastination ("I should start studying...tomorrow")
- Cafeteria food mysteries ("Is this really chicken?")
- Group projects where everyone waits until the last minute
- Forgetting homework and frantic excuses
- The awkwardness of speaking English in class
- Weekend plans that never quite happen
- Part-time job mishaps and awkward customers

**When to avoid humour:**
- Serious topics about social issues
- Personal or sensitive situations
- Anything that could be hurtful or divisive

### Seasonal Vocabulary Integration

**Domain-specific seasonal terms for Pre-2:**

| Seasonal Category | Pre-2 Vocabulary | Example Context |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **School calendar** | semester, entrance ceremony, graduation, exam, report card | School life and academic year |
| **Cultural events** | festival, celebration, tradition, holiday, custom | Cultural experiences |
| **Seasonal activities** | cherry blossom viewing, fireworks, summer festival, autumn leaves | Seasonal hobbies and activities |
| **Weather** | rainy season, humidity, autumn breeze, winter chill | Weather-related vocabulary |

## 7. Writing Guidelines — Sentence Length, Vocabulary, Complexity

### Sentence Length Requirements

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Average sentence length** | 15-18 words per sentence | **TV-readable with translations** |
| **Minimum sentence length** | 12 words | Avoid fragmentation |
| **Maximum sentence length** | 22 words | Hard limit for readability |
| **Sentence length variety** | 13-20 word range | Keep natural flow |
| **Percentage of sentences** (18+ words) | 20-30% | Occasional longer sentences only |

**Critical Constraint:** All sentences must be TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously.

**Note:** These targets are for individual sentences (lines 1-10), not total story word count. Each story contains exactly 20 lines.

### Sentence Length vs. Modal Density

**Strategy:** Keep sentences moderately long (15-18 words) while embedding modals naturally:

**Short sentences with modals:**
- *You can study at home.* (5 words — too simple)
- **Better:** *You can effectively study at home or in the library.* (9 words — still short)
- **Best (Pre-2 target):** *You can study more effectively at home or in the quiet library.* (13 words)

**Medium sentences with multiple modals:**
- *You should review your notes, and you must finish the assignment by Friday.* (14 words)
- **Better:** *You should review your notes carefully, and you must finish this assignment by Friday.* (15 words)

**Long sentences with modal + conditional:**
- *If you can learn these new words, you should be able to pass the exam.* (16 words)
- **Better:** *If you can learn these new vocabulary words, you should be able to pass the exam.* (17 words)

### Vocabulary Level Requirements

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Total vocabulary scope** | 1,862 words | From Pre-2 analysis |
| **Average per story** | 60-80 unique words | New + recycled vocabulary |
| **High-frequency words** | 40-50 words/story | Most common Pre-2 vocabulary |
| **Topic-specific vocabulary** | 10-15 words/story | School, hobbies, travel, etc. |
| **Modal verb density** | 8-12 modals/story | Primary feature of Pre-2 |

### Vocabulary Categories by Month

| Months | Domain Focus | Example Domains |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1-3 | Daily life & school | Study methods, classroom, friends |
| 4-6 | Travel & experiences | Trips, cultural events, new places |
| 7-9 | Hobbies & interests | Sports, music, technology, reading |
| 10-12 | Future & goals | Career plans, university, dreams |

### Tone and Engagement (IDEAL Quality Factors)

**Primary Tone:** Conversational, relatable, student-friendly

**Humour (Ideal to Include Where Appropriate):**
- Use gentle wit students will recognise
- Relatable student situations (exams, homework, procrastination)
- Playful commentary on school life
- Avoid sarcasm or cynicism — keep it warm and relevant

**Engagement Characteristics:**
- Relatable situations students experience
- Memorable examples that stick
- Balanced tone: friendly but educational
- Humour should be light, warm, and inclusive

**Example Humor Themes for Pre-2:**
- Exam stress and last-minute studying
- Cafeteria food that's "mysterious"
- Group projects where everyone forgets
- Part-time job awkward moments
- Weekend plans that change constantly
- Speaking English nervously in class

### Complexity Requirements

#### Clause Structure

| Requirement | Target | Example (15-18 words) |
|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Complex sentences** (subordinate clauses) | 30-40% of all sentences | Single independent + 1 dependent |
| **Compound sentences** | 30-40% of all sentences | Multiple independent clauses |
| **Simple sentences** | 20-30% of all sentences | Single independent clause |
| **Subordinate clause types** | At least 2 types per story | Relative, conditional clauses |

**Key Strategy:** Use modal verbs at natural points in 15-18 word sentences without overcomplicating.

**Example Transformation:**
- *Before (simple):* "You should study hard." (4 words — too simple)
- *After (Pre-2 level):* "You should study your vocabulary words carefully before the exam next week." (13 words — good) → *Better:* "You should study your vocabulary words very carefully before the important exam next week." (16 words — ideal)

#### Modal Distribution (EXACT COUNTS - CRITICAL)

| Requirement | Target per Story |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Total modal verbs** | 8-12 instances (STRICT MINIMUM = 8) |
| **Can/Could** | 2-3 instances (in focus or mixed weeks) |
| **Should/Must** | 2-3 instances (in focus or mixed weeks) |
| **Would/Might** | 1-2 instances (in focus or mixed weeks) |
| **Modal variety** | At least 4 different modal types per story |

**Note:** Modal target is 8-12 per story. The modal explosion (88 occurrences in Pre-2 exams) means modals must appear constantly.

**Weekly Modal Focus Requirements:**

| Week Type | Primary Modals | Secondary Modals | Target Count |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Week 1 (MIXED)** | All 6 modals equally | — | 2 of each type (12 total) |
| **Week 2 (Can/Could Focus)** | can, could, can't, couldn't | should, must, would, might | 4-6 focus modals + 2-4 others |
| **Week 3 (MIXED)** | All 6 modals equally | — | 2 of each type (12 total) |
| **Week 4 (Should/Must Focus)** | should, must, shouldn't, mustn't | can, could, would, might | 4-6 focus modals + 2-4 others |
| **Week 5 (MIXED + Conditionals)** | All 6 modals equally | 1st conditionals | 2 of each type + 1-2 conditionals |
| **Week 6 (Would/Might Focus)** | would, might, wouldn't | can, could, should, must | 4-6 focus modals + 2-4 others |
| **Week 7 (MIXED + Gerunds)** | All 6 modals equally | gerunds/infinitives | 2 of each type + 2-3 verb patterns |
| **Week 8 (Conditional Focus)** | Modals in conditionals | 1st conditionals | 3-4 conditionals + 4-6 modals |

#### 1st Conditional Distribution

| Requirement | Target per Story |
|-------------|------------------|
| **1st conditional sentences** | 1-3 instances (Week 5+ onwards) |
| **If...will** | 1-2 instances |
| **Unless** | 0-1 instances |
| **When** (certainty) | 0-1 instances |
| **Modal + conditional** | 1-2 instances |

**Note:** 1st conditionals appear starting Week 5. Weeks 1-4 focus only on modal verbs.

#### Gerund/Infinitive Distribution

| Requirement | Target per Story |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Verb + gerund** | 2-3 instances (Week 7+ onwards) |
| **Verb + infinitive** | 2-3 instances (Week 7+ onwards) |
| **Verb + both** | 1-2 instances (optional) |

**Note:** Gerunds/infinitives appear starting Week 7. Earlier weeks focus primarily on modals.

### Cohesion and Coherence

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| **Paragraph transitions** | Natural flow in 10-story-line sequence |
| **Thematic consistency** | One coherent topic per story |
| **Logical flow** | Simple to complex (starting point → elaboration) |
| **Referential clarity** | Pronouns with clear antecedents |

## 9. Story Structure — Format Requirements

### Content Format Requirements

Each story contains 20 lines total:
- **Lines 1-10:** 10 STORY sentences with emoji + English + Japanese
- **Lines 11-20:** 10 DISCUSSION questions with emoji + English + Japanese

**⚠️ CRITICAL JAPANESE TRANSLATION RULE:**

**ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS**

Lines 1-10 (Story sentences): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)
Lines 11-20 (Questions): Emoji + English + Japanese (three parts)

**EVERY LINE format:**
```
[Emoji] [English: 15-18 words]
[Japanese translation]
```

**❌ WRONG (missing Japanese on questions):**
```
📚 Can you study English every day?
Q? Should students use smartphones in class?
```

**✅ CORRECT (Japanese on ALL lines):**
```
📚 Can you study English every day without help?
助けなしで毎日英語を勉強できますか？

🎯 Should students use smartphones during class discussions?
クラスディスカッション中に学生はスマートフォンを使うべきですか？
```

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

**Story Sentences (Lines 1-10):**
- About a specific theme (e.g., study methods, summer vacation, career goals)
- Each sentence is 15-18 words
- Sentences form a cohesive narrative about the topic
- Grammar features: modal verbs (can/could/should/must/would/might), conditionals, gerunds/infinitives

**Discussion Questions (Lines 11-20):**
- **STAND-ALONE personal discussion questions** anyone can answer from their own knowledge/opinion
- Each question is 15-18 words
- Questions use **similar grammar/vocabulary** to the story but are about the **THEME**, not the story content
- Questions do NOT require reading the story
- Questions are conversation/discussion prompts for students to give personal opinions

**Example:**

**Story Sentences (about summer vacation):**
```
☀️ You should plan your summer vacation activities early this year.
今年は早めに夏休みの活動を計画すべきです。

🎒 You must prepare all necessary luggage before your trip starts.
旅行が始まる前に、すべての必要な荷物を準備する必要があります。
[... 8 more story sentences ...]
```

**Discussion Questions (about the theme - vacation and travel):**
```
🏖️ Should you travel far or stay local this summer?

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Should you spend more time with family or friends?
家族と過ごす時間を多くすべきですか、それとも友達と？
[... 8 more questions about vacations, travel, summer activities ...]
```

**Pattern:** Same format for ALL 20 lines:

```
😊 English sentence OR question (15-18 words).
日本語の翻訳です。
```

### Quality Control Checklist

Before finalizing any story, verify:

#### Grammar Verification

- [ ] Modal verbs count is 8-12 (minimum 8 required)
- [ ] Modal variety includes at least 4 different types
- [ ] Modal usage is natural and contextually appropriate
- [ ] 1st conditionals appear in Weeks 5+ only (1-3 instances)
- [ ] Gerunds/infinitives appear in Weeks 7+ only (2-3 instances)
- [ ] Sentence complexity is appropriate for Pre-2 level

#### Vocabulary Verification

- [ ] Vocabulary matches Pre-2 level (1,862-word scope)
- [ ] High-frequency words used primarily
- [ ] Domain terminology is accurate to theme
- [ ] Sentence length is 15-18 words average (max 22)
- [ ] Word count is 60-80 unique vocabulary per story

#### Coherence Verification

- [ ] Story topic is coherent and consistent
- [ ] Logical flow from simple to complex
- [ ] Modals appear naturally in context
- [ ] Topic is relatable to Pre-2 students
- [ ] Engaging and interesting (humour where appropriate)

#### Format Verification

- [ ] Story contains exactly 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 questions)
- [ ] **ALL 20 lines have Japanese translations**
- [ ] Questions have Japanese translations (not just story sentences)
- [ ] Questions are about THEME, not story comprehension
- [ ] Emoji used on every line
- [ ] No empty lines within content
- [ ] Correct array format: `var eikenpre2aligned = [`

#### Exam Alignment Verification

- [ ] Modals are the PRIMARY feature (8-12 instances)
- [ ] 1st conditionals are introduced (Week 5+)
- [ ] Passive voice is light (5 occurrences max — NOT dominant)
- [ ] Topics are student-appropriate (school, hobbies, travel, future)
- [ ] Sentences are 15-18 words (TV readable)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Insufficient modal count** → 8-12 modals per story is MANDATORY. Minimum 8 required.
2. **Limited modal variety** → Must use at least 4 different modal types per story.
3. **Overlong sentences** → Maximum 22 words; average should be 15-18 words.
4. **Missing Japanese on questions** → ALL 20 lines must have Japanese translations (Lines 11-20 included).
5. **Questions test story comprehension** → Questions should be about THEME, not story details.
6. **Conditionals too early** → 1st conditionals only in Weeks 5+ (Weeks 1-4 = modals only).
7. **Gerunds/infinitives too early** → Verb patterns only in Weeks 7+ (earlier weeks = modals focus).
8. **Modal usage is unnatural** → Modals must appear naturally, not forced into every sentence.

## Appendix: Content Creation Workflow (Required Process)

### Step 1: Create 48-Story Plan Document (MANDATORY First Step)

**Before generating ANY stories, create:**

`TEXTBOOK-PLAN-EIKENPRE2.md` — Master planning document with:

- All 48 stories outlined (Weeks 1-48)
- Title and theme for each story
- Grammar focus by week (8-week rotating pattern)
- Modal type by week (Can/Could, Should/Must, Would/Might, Mixed)
- 1st conditional requirement (Week 5+ only)
- Gerund/infinitive requirement (Week 7+ only)
- Sentence length requirement (15-18 words)
- Modal count requirement (8-12 instances)
- Japanese translation requirement (ALL 20 lines)

**NOTE:** All 48 stories are at the SAME 準2級 difficulty level. Weekly changes provide VARIETY (different modal focus), NOT PROGRESSION.

### Step 2: Generate Content Based on Plan

**After plan is complete:**

1. Worker agent generates stories following the plan
2. Reviewer agent checks stories against plan
3. If approved: Save and continue
4. If rejected: Fix, retry

### Step 3: Quality Review and Approval

**Every story MUST pass:**

- [ ] Plan requirements followed
- [ ] Japanese translations on ALL 20 lines
- [ ] Modal count: 8-12 instances (minimum 8)
- [ ] Modal variety: at least 4 different types
- [ ] 1st conditionals: 1-3 instances (Week 5+ only)
- [ ] Gerunds/infinitives: 2-3 instances (Week 7+ only)
- [ ] Sentence length: 15-18 words (max 22)

### Workflow Summary

```
1. Blueprint (SPEC) ✅ Complete
2. Plan (TEXTBOOK-PLAN) ✅ Complete ← FIRST STEP
3. Worker agent → generates stories based on plan
4. Reviewer agent → checks against plan
5. Approval/rejection → proceed or fix
6. Repeat for all 48 stories
```

**Critical Rule:** NEVER generate content without a plan document first. The plan is the single source of truth for what each story must contain.

### NO PROGRESSION Principle (Critical Design)

**All 48 stories are at the SAME 準2級 difficulty level:**

- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Weekly Changes = Variety Only (NOT Progression):**

- Different modal focus types for variety
- Different topics for variety
- NO "building phase" or "mastery phase"

This makes infinite content generation possible for a real skill.
