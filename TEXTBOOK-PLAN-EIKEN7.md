**Created:** 24 February 2026  
**Based on:** SPEC-EIKEN7-ALIGNED.md Version 1.0 (PROVISIONAL)  
**Calendar:** CALENDAR-MAPPING-2026.md  
**Total Stories:** 48 (4 stories/month × 12 months)  
**Curriculum Duration:** 12 months (48 weeks)

---

## ⚠️ PROVISIONAL DISCLAIMER — CRITICAL

**This plan is EDUCATED GUESSWORK based on official Eiken announcement PDF, NOT actual exam data.**

**Key Limitations:**
- No actual Grade 7 past exams exist yet (not administered as of 2026-02-24)
- This plan extrapolates from official announcement details only
- Grammar priorities, vocabulary distribution, and question patterns are PROVISIONAL estimates
- **This plan must be revised when actual Grade 7 exam data becomes available**

**Reliance:** This plan uses findings from `research-eiken67-levels.md` which analysed the official Eiken announcement PDF. It does NOT reflect test reality from actual exams because none exist yet.

**Required Action:** When official Grade 7 first administration occurs (late 2026 or 2027), analyse the actual exam PDFs and revise this plan accordingly.

---

## 1. Overview

### Curriculum Summary
- **Total stories:** 48 (Weeks 1-48)
- **Format per story:** 20 lines (10 sentences + 10 discussion questions)
- **Sentence length:** 5-8 words average (TV-readable with Japanese translations displayed simultaneously)
- **Reading passages:** 20-30 words total (3-4 sentences per story)
- **ALL lines (1-20):** Emoji + English (5-8 words) + Japanese translation

**⚠️ CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE: NO PROGRESSION**

**All 48 stories are at the SAME Grade 7 difficulty level.** No progressive building to "mastery."

**Why No Progression:**
- Students can join the level at ANY week (Week 1, Week 25, Week 45, etc.)
- Students read stories in order starting from the week they join
- Week 1 must be the same level as Week 48
- Each story is self-contained

**Monthly Changes = Vocabulary Variety Only (NOT Grammar Progression):**
- Grammar is IDENTICAL across all 48 stories (Be-verb + Present Simple ONLY)
- Vocabulary varies by month (theme-based)
- Different topics for variety (family, animals, colours, numbers, food, toys, school, games, friends, seasons, routines, celebrations)
- NO grammar categories, NO "focus weeks," NO "mastery phase"

**Every Single Story (Weeks 1-48) Must Have:**
- Be-verb sentences: 3-5 instances
- Present Simple sentences: 5-7 instances
- Yes/No questions: 10 total (story end)
- Sentence length: 5-8 words (max 10)
- Japanese translations: ALL 20 lines

This makes infinite content generation possible for a very low level — any week can be a student's first or last at Grade 7 level.

### Story Structure
**Lines 1-10:** Story sentences (simple everyday content about a theme)  
**Lines 11-20:** Discussion questions (simple questions about the theme)

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE:** ALL 20 LINES MUST HAVE JAPANESE TRANSLATIONS — NO EXCEPTIONS

**Format:**
```
😊 English sentence or question (3-8 words).
日本語の翻訳
```

### Grammar Strategy
ALL 48 stories use IDENTICAL grammar (MIXED pattern):
- Be-verb forms: "is", "are", "am"
- Present Simple: "I like...", "She plays...", "They run..."
- Questions: Yes/No only ("Is it...?", "Do you...?")

**EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED:**
- NO Present Continuous ("is jumping", "are playing")
- NO Past Simple ("liked", "played")
- NO Past Be-verb ("was", "were")
- NO Modals ("can", "could", "should", "must")
- NO Complex Wh-questions ("Why", "When", "How")
- NO Conjunctions ("and", "but", "or")

This is the **lowest** Eiken level — grammar is deliberately minimal.

### Grade 7 Profile (From Official Announcement)
- **Vocabulary:** 50-200 words (target ~150 average)
- **Grammar:** Present Simple + Be-verb ONLY
- **Sentence length:** 5-8 words average (ultra-short)
- **Reading passages:** 20-30 words (3-4 sentences)
- **Writing section:** None (official format)
- **Level position:** BELOW Grade 6 and Grade 5 (new lowest level)
- **Focus:** Vocabulary acquisition, NOT grammar (explicitly stated in announcement)

## 2. Grammar Pattern — MIXED ONLY (NO Progression)

### Grade 7 Grammar Pattern

**Pattern:** MIXED — ALL 48 stories at identical difficulty

| Grammar Feature | Frequency per Story | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Be-verb sentences** | 3-5 instances | "This is a cat." |
| **Present Simple sentences** | 5-7 instances | "I like dogs." |
| **Yes/No questions** | 10 total (story end) | "Is it red?", "Do you like...?" |

**Total sentences per story:** 10 (all Be-verb or Present Simple)

**NO progression across 48 weeks** — grammatical complexity does NOT increase.

### Grammar Inventory (PROVISIONAL)

**Based on official announcement, Grade 7 grammar includes ONLY:**

| Grammar Feature | Forms Include | Stories Using This | Notes |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Be-verb (Present)** | is, are, am | ALL 48 stories | Core structure |
| **Present Simple** | I like, She plays, They walk | ALL 48 stories | Core structure |
| **Basic Yes/No Questions** | Is it...? Do you...? | ALL 48 stories (questions only) | Simple questions only |

**EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED (based on announcement):**

| Grammar Feature | Reason for Exclusion |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Present Continuous | NOT mentioned in announcement |
| Past Simple | NOT mentioned in announcement |
| Past Be-verb (was/were) | NOT mentioned in announcement |
| Modals (can, could, should, must) | NOT mentioned in announcement |
| Complex Wh-questions | Announcement specifies VERY short exchanges only |
| Prepositions (in, on, at) | Too complex for ultra-simple stories |

| **November** | 41-44 | Story 41-44 | Daily Routines | MIXED |
| **December** | 45-48 | Story 45-48 | Celebrations | MIXED |

**Verification Rule:** Each story's theme should align with its month's focus.
- Example: Story 5 (January → February crossover) should be about animals
- Example: Story 29 (August) should be about playing games

**MIXED Pattern:**
- ALL 48 stories use MIXED grammar (Be-verb + Present Simple)
- NO "focus weeks" or "grammar progression"
- Students can start ANY week — all stories are same difficulty

## 5. Grammar Requirements per Story (CRITICAL)

### Be-Verb Sentences: 3-5 Instances
- **Target:** 3-5 instances per story (Lines 1-10 only)  
- **Forms:** is, are, am  
- **Uses:** Simple descriptions ("This is a cat."), locations ("My school is here."), qualities ("The sky is blue.")

### Present Simple Sentences: 5-7 Instances
- **Target:** 5-7 instances per story (Lines 1-10 only)  
- **Pattern:** Subject + Verb (s form for third person singular)  
- **Uses:** Actions ("I like dogs.", "She plays games."), habits ("We walk to school.")

### Yes/No Questions: 10 Total (Lines 11-20)
- **Target:** 10 questions total (Lines 11-20)  
- **Types:** 
  - Be-verb questions: "Is it red?", "Are they happy?" (4-5 questions)
  - Present Simple DO questions: "Do you like apples?", "Does he play?" (4-5 questions)
- **Answers:** One-syllable answers preferred ("Yes", "No", "Cat", "Red")

### Sentence Length: 5-8 Words (TV-Readable Constraint)
- **Average:** 5-8 words per sentence  
- **Maximum:** 10 words per sentence (hard limit)  
- **Apply to:** ALL 20 lines (both story sentences AND discussion questions)

### Grammar Simplicity Strategy

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY simple sentences**

**❌ WRONG (too complex):**
- *Compound:* "The cat is black and it likes to play." (9 words, conjunction "and")
- *Continuous:* "The cat is jumping on the bed." (7 words, Present Continuous)
- *Past tense:* "The cat jumped on the bed." (6 words, Past Simple)
- *Modal:* "The cat can jump on the bed." (7 words, modal "can")

**✅ CORRECT (Grade 7 level):**
- *Simple Be-verb:* "The cat is black." (5 words)
- *Simple Present:* "The cat plays." (4 words)
- *Two simple sentences:* "The cat is black. It plays." (5 + 3 words, two simple sentences)

**Splitting Strategy:**
If content needs conjunctions or complex structures, split into two simple sentences:
- ❌ "I like apples and bananas and grapes." (7 words, multiple "and")
- ✅ "I like apples. I like bananas. I like grapes." (4 + 4 + 4 words)

---

## 6. Content Quality Guidelines

### Primary Priority: Simple, Relatable Content
- **Above all:** Stories should be relatable to young children (ages 5-8 estimated)  
- **Readability:** 5-8 word sentences ensure TV readability with translations  
- **Simple tone:** Friendly, cheerful, easy to understand  
- **Topic relevance:** Everyday topics (family, animals, colours, food, toys, school, games, friends, seasons, routines, celebrations)

### Secondary Priority: Repetition and Pattern Recognition
**Use repetition to help young learners recognise patterns:**

**Repetition strategies:**
- Repeat key nouns ("The cat... The cat... The cat...")
- Repeat sentence structures ("It is red. It is blue. It is green.")
- Use familiar themes each week within a month
- Maintain consistent question patterns ("Is it...?", "Do you...?")

**Pattern recognition benefits:**
- Students recognise grammar THROUGH exposure (not through explicit teaching)
- Repetition builds confidence with each story
- Familiar patterns reduce cognitive load for very young learners

### Tertiary Priority: Positive Emotions and Joy
**Keep content positive and cheerful:**

**Positive emotion themes:**
- Happy families
- Cute animals
- Bright colours
- Tasty food
- Fun games
- Good friends
- Enjoyable routines
- Happy celebrations

**Emotion principles:**
- Focus on positive feelings (happy, love, fun, nice, good)
- Avoid negative emotions unless simple comparisons (happy vs. sad)
- Use cheerful emojis matching the content
- Keep stories uplifting and encouraging

### Topic Flexibility
**Stories should stay within the monthly theme but can vary:**

**Example flexibility within "Animals I Like" (February):**
- Story 5: Pets at home (cat and dog)
- Story 6: Farm visit (see farm animals)
- Story 7: Zoo trip (see big animals)
- Story 8: Garden bugs (find small animals)

**Quality principle:** Theme flexibility allows creators to choose child-friendly variations within each monthly topic
