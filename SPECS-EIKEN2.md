## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Incorrect modal perfects — "should have done" not "should did"
- ❌ Passive voice errors — especially with complex tenses
- ❌ Too informal register — this level requires formal tone

### Vocabulary
- ❌ Too simple vocabulary — aim for B2 level (5,000-7,500 words)
- ❌ Slang/colloquialisms — maintain formal register
- ❌ Inappropriate topic complexity — topics should be challenging but accessible

### Content
- ❌ Too conversational — maintain academic/professional tone

- ❌ Lacking nuance — questions should explore multiple perspectives
