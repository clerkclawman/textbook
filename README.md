## 📊 Eiken Level Alignment

| Level | Grade | File | Grammar Focus |
|-------|-------|------|---------------|
| **Pre-1** | 準1級 | `eikenpre1.js` | Discourse markers, academic register |
| **Pre-2+** | 準2級プラス | `eikenpre2plus.js` | Passive voice → Active voice (natural) |
| **Pre-2** | 準2級 | `eikenpre2.js` | Modals (can, could, may, might, must) |
| **Grade 1** | 1級 | `eiken1.js` | Advanced grammar, formal language |
| **Grade 2** | 2級 | `eiken2.js` | Complex modals, conditional structures |
| **Grade 3** | 3級 | `eiken3.js` | Natural conversation, reduced adverbs |
| **Grade 4** | 4級 | `eiken4.js` | Intermediate vocabulary |
| **Grade 5** | 5級 | `eiken5.js` | Basic to intermediate grammar |
| **Grade 6** | 6級 | `eiken6.js` | Fundamental skills |
| **Grade 7** | 7級 | `eiken7.js` | Beginning level |

**Note:** Eiken progression is non-linear. Grade 6/7 are new levels (2026), and Pre-2+ bridges Pre-2 to Grade 2 gaps.

## 🎯 How This Differs From Official Descriptions

**Official Eiken descriptions** say what a level *should* test.
**This textbook** teaches what exams *actually* test.

**Example:** Official Pre-2 level says "passive voice," but in practice, forced passive constructions appear more naturally at Pre-2+. This reflects the real exam reality discovered through analysis of past exam PDFs.

## ✨ Recent Updates

### February 28, 2026 — Natural English Fixes
- **Removed forced adverbs** — AI overly used "brightly, happily, heavily" across all levels
- **Passive → Active** — Unnatural passive constructions converted to active voice
- **Fixed forced modals** — Modals were inserted where they don't naturally occur
- **Removed "reportedly"** — Excessive discourse markers eliminated
- **Simplified vocabulary** — "Incumbent," "disillusioned," etc. replaced with natural language

**Commit:** `c18cb25` — "Comprehensive natural English fixes across all levels"

**Lesson Learned:** AI understands grammar rules but not natural language flow. Human review is essential.
